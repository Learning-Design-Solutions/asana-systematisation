## Andrew's Complete Feedback

### ✅ COMMENTS SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED

**Status**: **3 COMMENTS FOUND AND EXTRACTED**

Using `mcp__google_workspace__read_document_comments`, successfully extracted 3 comments from the Google Doc. Analysis reveals that **all comments have already been integrated into the document as footnotes** - no new feedback to incorporate.

### Comment Analysis

**Comment 1 - Andrew Doig (2025-10-15)**
- **Content**: "Launch date and go live date are the same thing. we have 'ready to launch' and 'launch'"
- **Status**: ✅ Already integrated as **Footnote [b]** in Section 3.1
- **Impact**: Terminology clarification - confirms "launch date" and "go live date" are synonymous

**Comment 2 - Vlad Tudorie (2025-10-14)**
- **Content**: "Has been super inconsistent with current client, tends to be lighter touch than proofreading."
- **Status**: ✅ Already integrated as **Footnote [c]** in Section 4.3
- **Source**: Vlad documenting Andrew's verbal feedback about academic reviewer behavior
- **Impact**: Informational note about review quality expectations

**Comment 3 - Vlad Tudorie (2025-10-14)**
- **Content**: "NOTE: Launch is not Andrew's task. Andrew's job is to get everything ready for launch. Launch is the client's responsibility."
- **Status**: ✅ Already integrated as **Footnote [a]** in Section 2.2
- **Source**: Vlad documenting Andrew's verbal feedback about launch responsibility
- **Impact**: Clarifies ownership boundaries in project workflow

### Key Finding

**All Google Doc comments have been successfully integrated into the document**. The comments represent feedback that was:
1. Provided by Andrew verbally or in previous discussions
2. Documented by Vlad as comments in Google Docs (Oct 14-15, 2025)
3. Subsequently integrated as footnotes in the specification document

**No additional unintegrated feedback exists**. The document is current and complete with respect to Andrew's input captured through Oct 15, 2025.

## Embedded Feedback Already in Document

While no new comments were extractable, the document **already contains feedback from Andrew** embedded as inline notes and answers to questions. These are visible in both versions:

### Section 1.2: Launch Buffer Clarifications
**Original Question**: "Critical Note: Clarifications for the 10-week buffer between 'Ready for Launch' and 'Go Live'"

**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- "not a standard, just depends when the program the development for that specific module starts. So the module buffer (if it exists) depends on the program development lifecycle."
- "If a buffer exists, it tends to get used, which we would prefer to avoid."
- "the development is always done against launch dates."
- "sometimes clients do have a preference for that, but Andrew would prefer to negotiate around that. When a buffer exists, Andrew would require the management team to line-manage the academic resources."

### Section 1.3: Week 1 Rationale
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- "If the client truly wants to trim time, Andrew may be willing to reduce this to a week (and also in the Initiation and the QA/finalization phase), but in general, the 16-week schedule is already aggressive."
- "Note also that Week 1 Build overlaps with Week 2 Development (which means this DOES NOT lengthen the 16-week process). As much as possible activities happen concurrently."

### Section 4.2: Film Shoots
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- "1st option: If the Academic is physically present in London, they will come on campus and film"
- "2nd option: can't come into campus: will record themselves at their desk, use Loom's în their lectures → we get recorded videos"
- "3rd option is to use AI Avatars, but at a minimum would get recorded introductions"
- "Andrew suggests bringing in professional video production, but that brings a lot of extra cost"
- "Batches: dependent on availability of resources outside of Andrew's management, so they have to be very flexible. These windows are nominal and recommended to the client around the suggested times. Not nominal if there's no buffer - if the module MUST go live with no buffer, the film shoot schedule is non-negociable."

### Section 4.3: Finalization Dependencies
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- "Film shoot - is not dependent on Build completion, but on Storyboard completion. It can happen any time after Storyboards."
- "Proofreading does not depend on Film shoot - will proofread without the video in place."
- "Weeks 3 to 8 review depends on Week 8 Storyboard completion (not build)."

### Section 11.1: Christmas Week Reviews
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- Question 2: "Is this typical scheduling or an artifact of the example dates?"
  - **Answer**: "not typical, but will inevitably happen and must be accounted for."
- "How do we typically handle reviews falling on holidays?"
  - **Answer**: "2-week buffer signaling no work being done during these holidays."
- "Should we build in holiday detection/warnings?"
  - **Answer**: "yes, for Christmas, OR if the Academic signals out-of-office time during the program development schedule."

### Section 4.3: Academic Reviewer Consistency
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- Footnote [c]: "Has been super inconsistent with current client, tends to be lighter touch than proofreading."

### Section 2.2: Launch Section Note
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- Footnote [a]: "NOTE: Launch is not Andrew's task. Andrew's job is to get everything ready for launch. Launch is the client's responsibility."

### Section 3.1: Launch Date vs Go Live Date
**Andrew's Embedded Feedback** (already integrated):
- Footnote [b]: "Launch date and go live date are the same thing. we have 'ready to launch' and 'launch'"

## All Reviewer Feedback

**Status**: Only Andrew's feedback was expected and partially found (embedded inline).

**Other Reviewers**: None identified in the document metadata or version history.

## Actionable Changes Needed

### HIGH PRIORITY (Based on Embedded Feedback Already Received)

These changes should be made based on the feedback already integrated into the document:

1. **Clarify Launch Buffer Terminology** (Section 1.2, 3.1, 4.4)
   - **Issue**: Confusion between "Launch Date", "Ready for Launch", "Go Live Date"
   - **Action**: Update custom field names and descriptions to use "Ready for Launch Date" as anchor and "Go Live Date" as separate field
   - **Impact**: High - affects all relative date calculations

2. **Implement Holiday Detection System** (Section 11.1, Question 2)
   - **Issue**: Christmas week reviews and other holiday conflicts
   - **Action**: Build automated holiday detection for Christmas and Academic out-of-office periods
   - **Implementation**: Add warning system in Asana template with 2-week buffer flagging
   - **Impact**: High - prevents scheduling conflicts

3. **Film Shoot Dependency Correction** (Section 4.3)
   - **Issue**: Documentation implies film shoots depend on Build completion
   - **Action**: Update dependency chains to show film shoots depend on Storyboard completion only
   - **Implementation**: Revise Section 6.2 "Finalization Dependencies"
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects project timeline flexibility

4. **Clarify Film Shoot Options** (Section 4.2, 5.6)
   - **Issue**: Three film shoot options not clearly documented in task specifications
   - **Action**: Add film shoot options to task descriptions and decision tree
   - **Implementation**: Update Section 5.6 with option selection criteria
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects media requirements planning

5. **Academic Reviewer Consistency Note** (Section 8.2)
   - **Issue**: Reviewer behavior documented but not integrated into task planning
   - **Action**: Add note about lighter-touch academic reviews in Weeks 3-8 review task description
   - **Implementation**: Update Section 5.5 review task pattern
   - **Impact**: Low - informational, helps set expectations

6. **Launch Responsibility Clarity** (Section 4.4, 2.2)
   - **Issue**: Launch section implies Andrew owns "Go live" task
   - **Action**: Update "Go live" task description to clarify client responsibility
   - **Implementation**: Add note in Section 4.4 and task template (Section 5.1)
   - **Impact**: Low - clarifies ownership

- Question 16: Custom field priorities

**Section 11.7: Portfolio & Reporting Questions**
- Question 17: Portfolio structure preferences
- Question 18: Critical reporting needs
- Question 19: Client visibility and permissions

**Section 11.8: Integration & Migration Questions**
