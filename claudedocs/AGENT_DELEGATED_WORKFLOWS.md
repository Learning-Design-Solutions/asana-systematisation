# Asana Systematisation Project - Agent-Delegated Workflow Recommendations
**Generated**: 2025-10-20
**Analysis Type**: Complete agent/skill inventory with delegation strategy
**Supersedes**: WORKFLOW_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive filesystem exploration of `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/plugins/`, discovered **16 local specialized agents** and **extensive skill libraries**. This document redesigns all workflows to **delegate tasks to specialized agents** carrying their own domain-specific context, rather than attempting all work directly.

**Key Finding**: This is a **project management template systematisation project**, NOT a software development project. Most code-focused agents are irrelevant. The 5 high-value agents identified enable 50% time reduction through specialization and parallel execution.

**Strategic Approach**: Agent delegation as primary execution model → Specialized expertise + dedicated context → Higher quality output with improved efficiency

## Revised Workflows with Agent Delegation

### 🎯 Priority 1: Immediate (This Week)

#### Workflow 1: Asana Template Finalization
**Time**: 60 minutes
**Handler**: Direct execution (me + Asana MCP)
**Status**: READY TO EXECUTE

**Rationale**: Simple CRUD operations don't benefit from agent delegation

**Tasks**:
1. Film shoot task updates (3 options: Physical/Loom/AI avatars)
2. Academic review warnings (consistency note)
3. Launch clarification (Andrew vs client)
4. Week 1 rationale (10-day duration explanation)
5. Dependency correction (Film shoot → Week 4 Storyboard)
6. Validation

**No Agent Delegation Needed**: Direct Asana MCP operations are most efficient

## Agent Invocation Mechanics

### Using the Task Tool

**Syntax**:
```python
Task(
    description="Short 3-5 word description",
    prompt="Detailed task description with full context",
    subagent_type="agent-name"
)
```

**Available Subagent Types for This Project**:
- `technical-writer` → Documentation creation
- `deep-research-agent` → Research and exploration
- `system-architect` → Architecture design
- `requirements-analyst` → Specification refinement
- `business-panel-experts` → Strategic review

### Best Practices for Agent Delegation

1. **Provide Complete Context**:
   - Specify all relevant files to read
   - Explain project background
   - Define target audience
   - Clarify success criteria

2. **Clear Deliverables**:
   - Specify output format (markdown, JSON, etc.)
   - Define structure and sections
   - Set length expectations
   - Indicate file placement

3. **Respect Agent Expertise**:
   - Don't micromanage approach
   - Let agents use their specialized knowledge
   - Trust their domain expertise
   - Review outputs, don't dictate methods

4. **Sequential Dependencies**:
   - Workflow 9 (Architecture) requires Workflow 5 (Research) completion
   - Other workflows can run in parallel
   - Plan execution order carefully

---

## Execution Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation (This Week)
```yaml
Sequence:
  step_1:
    workflows: [1, 2]
    execution: parallel
    description: "Asana updates (me) + Documentation (technical-writer)"
    time: 60 minutes wall time

  step_2:
    workflow: 3
    execution: sequential (depends on 1-2)
    description: "GitHub PR creation"
    time: 30 minutes

  step_3:
    action: manual_review
    owner: Andrew
    description: "Template review with Andrew"

Total_Time: ~2.5 hours
Status: READY TO EXECUTE
```

### Week 2: Enhancement (Next Week)
```yaml
Parallel_Execution:
  track_1:
    workflow: 4
    agents: [technical-writer, system-architect]
    time: 3 hours

  track_2:
    workflow: 5
    agent: deep-research-agent
    time: 2 hours

  track_3:
    workflow: 6
    skill: xlsx
    time: 2 hours

Execution_Strategy: "All 3 tracks run simultaneously"
Wall_Time: 3 hours (maximum of the three)
Total_Work: 7 hours
Time_Saved: 4 hours through parallelization
Benefits:
  - 50% time reduction
  - Higher quality through specialization
  - Maintained separate contexts
```

### Week 3-4: Integration (Following Weeks)
```yaml
Sequential_Execution:
  workflow_7:
    agent: business-panel-experts
    time: 1 hour

  workflow_8:
    agent: requirements-analyst
    time: 1 hour

  workflow_9:
    agent: system-architect
    dependencies: [workflow_5]
    time: 2 hours

Total_Time: 4 hours
Dependency_Note: "Workflow 9 requires Workflow 5 completion"
```

**Total Project Time**: 10-12 hours across 3 weeks
**Key Benefit**: Agent specialization + parallel execution = 50% time reduction with improved quality

- All three are independent and can run simultaneously
- Total wall time: 3 hours vs 7 hours sequential
- **57% time reduction through intelligent parallelization**

### Token Efficiency
- Agents carry their own context → reduced context window pressure
- Specialized knowledge loaded per-agent → no context waste
- Parallel execution → no waiting time between tasks
- Skill-based operations → optimized for specific tasks

### Quality Through Specialization
- technical-writer → Better documentation than generic approach
- deep-research-agent → More comprehensive research with confidence scoring
- system-architect → Professional architecture vs ad-hoc design
- business-panel-experts → Multi-perspective strategic validation
- requirements-analyst → Professional specification quality

---

## Key Insights

### 🌟 Strategic Discoveries

1. **Agent Delegation is the Primary Efficiency Lever**
   - Each agent carries specialized context and expertise
   - Delegation enables true parallel execution
   - Quality improves through domain specialization
   - Context window pressure reduced dramatically

2. **Project Type Determines Agent Relevance**
   - This is template systematisation (NOT coding)
   - 5/16 agents highly relevant, 11 not applicable
   - Proper agent selection critical for efficiency
   - Wrong agent choice wastes time and context

3. **deep-research-agent is Perfect for n8n Exploration**
   - Multi-hop reasoning for discovering capabilities
   - Tool orchestration (n8n MCP + Tavily search)
   - Confidence-scored recommendations
   - Self-reflective quality validation

4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration Enables Complex Deliverables**
   - Workflow 4: technical-writer + system-architect
   - Each focuses on their expertise domain
   - Combined output superior to single-agent approach
   - Parallel execution maintains efficiency

5. **Skills (xlsx, docx, pdf) Complement Agent Work**
   - Agents generate content, skills format it
   - Professional document conversion
   - Stakeholder-appropriate deliverable formats
   - xlsx dashboard provides executive-friendly interface

### 💡 Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Agent Delegation**: Week 1 Workflow 2 validates the approach before scaling
2. **Parallel Everything Possible**: Week 2 demonstrates maximum parallelization
3. **Sequence Strategic Workflows**: Week 3-4 builds on earlier work
4. **Maintain Agent Context**: Let agents read their own inputs, don't summarize
5. **Trust Agent Expertise**: Provide goals and constraints, not detailed instructions

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Agent Involved |
|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Agent output quality varies | MEDIUM | Review and refine outputs, provide feedback loops | All agents |
| n8n learning curve steeper than expected | MEDIUM | Deep-research-agent provides phased learning path | deep-research-agent |
| Parallel execution coordination complexity | LOW | Clear dependency mapping, sequential fallback | All workflows |

### Workflow Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Agent Involved |
|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Andrew requests significant changes | MEDIUM | Version control + requirements-analyst for clarification | requirements-analyst |
| Agent delegation overhead | LOW | Start with one agent (Workflow 2) to validate approach | technical-writer |
| Context handoff between agents | MEDIUM | Explicit file references, clear deliverable boundaries | All agents |

## Comparison to Original Approach

### Original WORKFLOW_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- ❌ No agent delegation - I did everything directly
- ❌ Limited by single context window
- ❌ Sequential execution bottleneck
- ❌ Generic approach without specialization
- ⚠️ Underutilized available capabilities

### Agent-Delegated Approach (This Document)
- ✅ 5 specialized agents handling their domains
- ✅ Each agent has dedicated context window
- ✅ True parallel execution in Week 2
- ✅ Specialized expertise for each task
- ✅ Full utilization of available capabilities

**Result**: 50% time reduction + improved quality through specialization
