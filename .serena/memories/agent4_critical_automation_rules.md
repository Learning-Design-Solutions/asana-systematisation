# Critical Automation Rules Design - Phase 3 Complete
**Agent**: Agent 4 - Critical Automation Rules Design Agent
**Phase**: Phase 3 Execution - Detailed Rule Specifications
**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Coordinator Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Deliverable**: Complete design specifications for 5 critical automation rules prioritized for pilot launch (mid-late November 2025)

**Philosophy**: Simplicity-first approach using native Asana rules. Complex logic (AI Studio, API) deferred to post-pilot iterations.

**Platform**: Native Asana Rules (Advanced tier - 25,000 actions/month)
- Fallback: AI Studio for Rule 2 (next resource notification with intelligent routing)
- Monitoring: Launch Date change notification only (no automatic recalculation per Agent 2 findings)

**Integration Points**:
- Agent 1 Custom Fields: Module Status, QA Status, Blocker Status (all Single Select fields with documented enum values)
- Agent 2 API Scripts: Launch Date custom field (for notification context)
- Automation Budget: ~500 actions/month estimated for 10-module pilot

**Effort Estimate**: 4-6 hours total
- Rule configuration: 2 hours
- Testing & validation: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Training materials: 1 hour

## SECTION 1: RULE SPECIFICATIONS

### Rule 1: Module Status Propagation (P0 - Native Rules)

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (P0)
**Complexity**: Simple (single trigger → single action)
**Platform**: Native Asana Rules
**Estimated Actions/Month**: 80-100 (10 modules × 8 status changes average)

#### Business Purpose
Automatically update the module-level "Module Status" custom field when key section completion milestones are reached, providing real-time visibility into project progress without manual updates.

#### Trigger Logic
**Trigger Type**: Task completion event
**Trigger Conditions**: Specific milestone tasks completed

**Trigger Tasks** (by section):
1. **Planning → In Development**: "Module Planning Document (MPD) Completion" task completed
2. **In Development → Build**: "Week 8 Storyboard to Client" task completed
3. **Build → QA**: "Ready for Academic Review" task completed
4. **QA → Ready**: "Corrections and Uploading to VLE" task completed
5. **Ready → Launched**: "Go Live Date" (date-based trigger - when Go Live Date is reached)

#### Action Steps
**Action Type**: Update custom field value
**Target**: Parent project (module)
**Field**: "Module Status" (Custom Field GID: *to be documented*)

**State Transitions**:
```
Task: "MPD Completion" completed
  → Set Module Status = "In Development"

Task: "Week 8 Storyboard to Client" completed
  → Set Module Status = "Build"

Task: "Ready for Academic Review" completed
  → Set Module Status = "QA"

Task: "Corrections and Uploading to VLE" completed
  → Set Module Status = "Ready"

Date: Go Live Date reached
  → Set Module Status = "Launched"
```

#### Edge Cases & Validation

**Edge Case 1**: Task marked complete prematurely (before dependencies done)
- **Validation**: Asana dependency system prevents this (cannot complete if blockers exist)
- **Fallback**: If manually overridden, status change is valid (reflects optimistic state)

**Edge Case 2**: Task unmarked (completion toggled off)
- **Behavior**: Status remains at advanced state (no regression automation)
- **Rationale**: Prevents status thrashing; manual review required for regressions

**Edge Case 3**: Multiple status changes in same day
- **Behavior**: Each trigger fires independently, status advances sequentially
- **Automation Budget Impact**: Minimal (rare scenario)

**Edge Case 4**: Go Live Date trigger (date-based)
- **Limitation**: Native Asana rules do NOT support date-based triggers natively
- **Workaround**: Use "Go Live Date Reached" task completion as trigger instead
- **Implementation**: Create recurring task "Check for Go Live Date" (daily automation check)
- **Alternative**: Manual status update to "Launched" on go-live day (acceptable for pilot)

#### Asana Rule Configuration

**Rule Name**: "Module Status: Planning → In Development"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Task Name: "Module Planning Document (MPD) Completion"

Action:
  Type: Update custom field
  Target: Project
  Custom Field: "Module Status"
  New Value: "In Development"

Notification:
  Add comment to project: "✅ Module status updated to 'In Development' - MPD completed"
  Notify: Project members
```

**Rule Name**: "Module Status: In Development → Build"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Task Name: "Week 8 Storyboard to Client"

Action:
  Type: Update custom field
  Target: Project
  Custom Field: "Module Status"
  New Value: "Build"

Notification:
  Add comment to project: "✅ Module status updated to 'Build' - All storyboards completed"
  Notify: Project members
```

**Rule Name**: "Module Status: Build → QA"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Task Name: "Ready for Academic Review"

Action:
  Type: Update custom field
  Target: Project
  Custom Field: "Module Status"
  New Value: "QA"

Notification:
  Add comment to project: "✅ Module status updated to 'QA' - Ready for academic review"
  Notify: Project members
```

**Rule Name**: "Module Status: QA → Ready"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Task Name: "Corrections and Uploading to VLE"

Action:
  Type: Update custom field
  Target: Project
  Custom Field: "Module Status"
  New Value: "Ready"

Notification:
  Add comment to project: "✅ Module status updated to 'Ready' - Module ready for launch"
  Notify: Project members
```

**Rule Name**: "Module Status: Ready → Launched (Manual Trigger)"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "Module Status"
  Old Value: "Ready"
  New Value: "Launched"

Action:
  Add comment to project: "🚀 Module launched successfully on [Go Live Date]"
  Notify: All project members

Note: Manual status change on Go Live Date (no automatic date trigger for pilot)
```

#### Testing Plan

**Test Case 1**: Complete MPD task, verify status changes to "In Development"
```
1. Create test module from template
2. Mark "MPD Completion" task as complete
3. Verify "Module Status" field = "In Development"
4. Verify project comment added
5. Verify team notified
```

**Test Case 2**: Advance through all status transitions
```
1. Complete each milestone task sequentially
2. Verify status progresses: Planning → In Development → Build → QA → Ready
3. Verify notifications sent at each transition
4. Confirm no status regression when tasks uncompleted
```

**Test Case 3**: Rapid sequential completions
```
1. Complete MPD, Week 8 Storyboard, Ready for Review in quick succession
2. Verify all 3 status changes occur correctly
3. Check automation action count (should be 3)
```

**Test Case 4**: Dependency violation handling
```
1. Attempt to complete "Ready for Academic Review" before "Week 8 Storyboard to Client"
2. Verify Asana dependency system prevents completion
3. Confirm no status change occurs
```

### Rule 2: Next Resource Notification (P0 - AI Studio Recommended)

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (P0)
**Complexity**: Moderate (requires intelligent routing logic)
**Platform**: AI Studio (fallback: Native Rules with multiple rule variants)
**Estimated Actions/Month**: 500-700 (10 modules × 50-70 handoffs per module)

#### Business Purpose
Automatically notify the next resource (Learning Designer, Learning Technologist, SME, Client) when a task is completed and dependent tasks become actionable, reducing coordination overhead and preventing bottlenecks.

#### Trigger Logic
**Trigger Type**: Task completion event
**Trigger Conditions**: Task marked complete

**Intelligent Routing Logic**:
```
Task Completed
  → Identify dependent tasks (tasks blocked by this task)
  → For each dependent task:
      - Get assignee (Person field)
      - Check if task is now actionable (all blockers complete)
      - If actionable → Notify assignee
```

#### Action Steps
**Action Type**: Notify assignee of dependent task
**Notification Content**:
```
Subject: "Your task is now ready: [Task Name]"

Body:
"[Predecessor Task Name] has been completed by [Predecessor Assignee].

Your task '[Dependent Task Name]' is now ready to begin.

Due Date: [Task Due Date]
Estimated Duration: [Task Duration]

[Link to Task]"
```

#### Implementation Approaches

**Approach A: AI Studio Smart Workflow (RECOMMENDED)**

**Rationale**: AI Studio can handle complex dependency logic and intelligent routing without creating 50+ individual native rules.

**AI Workflow Configuration**:
```yaml
Name: "Next Resource Notification"

Trigger:
  Event: Task completed
  Scope: All tasks in project

Logic:
  1. Get completed task dependencies (tasks this task blocks)
  2. For each dependent task:
      - Check if all blockers now complete
      - If yes:
          - Get task assignee
          - Send notification with task details
          - Add comment to task: "Ready to start - predecessor completed"

Notification Template:
  Subject: "Task ready: {{task.name}}"
  Body: |
    Your task is now ready to begin:

    Task: {{task.name}}
    Due: {{task.due_on}}
    Predecessor: {{predecessor.name}} (completed by {{predecessor.assignee}})

    {{task.permalink_url}}

Rate Limiting:
  Max notifications per task: 1 (prevent duplicate notifications)
  Batch notifications: Yes (if multiple tasks become ready simultaneously)
```

**Approach B: Native Rules (Multiple Variants)**

**Rationale**: If AI Studio unavailable, create multiple native rules for key handoff points.

**Key Handoff Points** (10 critical rules):
1. MPD Complete → Week 1 Storyboard Start
2. Week N Storyboard to Client → Week N Build Start
3. Week N Build Complete → Week N+1 Storyboard Start
4. Week 8 Build Complete → Ready for Academic Review
5. Academic Review Complete → Corrections Start
6. Corrections Complete → Go Live Preparation
7. Film Shoot Script Complete → Film Shoot Booking
8. Film Shoot Complete → Video Editing
9. Video Editing Complete → Upload to VLE
10. QA Review Complete → Final Approvals

**Example Native Rule**: "Week 1 Storyboard → Week 1 Build"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Task Name: "Week 1 Storyboard to Client"

Action:
  Type: Notify assignee of dependent task
  Dependent Task: "Week 1 Build"
  Notification: |
    Week 1 Storyboard has been completed and sent to client.

    You can now begin building Week 1 content.

    Due Date: [Auto-filled by Asana]
    Duration: 10 days
```

**Trade-off Analysis**:
| Criterion | AI Studio | Native Rules (10 variants) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Coverage | Complete (all tasks) | Partial (10 key handoffs) |
| Maintenance | Low (1 workflow) | Medium (10 rules) |
| Complexity | Moderate setup | Simple per-rule |
| Flexibility | High (adapts to changes) | Low (hardcoded) |
| Cost | Included in Advanced tier | Included in Advanced tier |

**RECOMMENDATION**: Start with AI Studio (Approach A), fallback to Native Rules (Approach B) if AI Studio proves problematic during testing.

#### Edge Cases & Validation

**Edge Case 1**: Task has multiple dependencies (parallel work)
- **Behavior**: Notify assignee only when ALL dependencies complete
- **Validation**: Check dependency count before notification

**Edge Case 2**: Dependent task already completed
- **Behavior**: Skip notification (task already done)
- **Validation**: Check task completion status before notifying

**Edge Case 3**: No assignee on dependent task
- **Behavior**: Notify project owner or default to Senior LD
- **Validation**: Check assignee field, use fallback if empty

**Edge Case 4**: Multiple dependent tasks share same assignee
- **Behavior**: Send single batched notification listing all tasks
- **Validation**: Group notifications by assignee (AI Studio feature)

**Edge Case 5**: Circular dependencies (should never occur in template)
- **Behavior**: Asana prevents circular dependencies at creation
- **Validation**: Template validation prevents this scenario

#### Testing Plan

**Test Case 1**: Single dependency chain
```
1. Complete "Week 1 Storyboard to Client" task
2. Verify assignee of "Week 1 Build" receives notification
3. Confirm notification includes task link, due date, predecessor info
4. Check no duplicate notifications sent
```

**Test Case 2**: Multiple dependencies (parallel → convergence)
```
1. Setup: Task C depends on both Task A and Task B
2. Complete Task A → Verify NO notification (Task B still blocking)
3. Complete Task B → Verify notification sent to Task C assignee
4. Confirm notification mentions both Task A and Task B as complete
```

**Test Case 3**: Batch notifications (same assignee, multiple tasks)
```
1. Complete "Week 1 Build" → Unlocks "Week 2 Storyboard" and "Week 1 Review"
2. If both assigned to same person, verify single notification listing both tasks
3. If different assignees, verify separate notifications
```

**Test Case 4**: Missing assignee fallback
```
1. Complete task with dependent task having no assignee
2. Verify notification sent to Senior LD (project default)
3. Confirm notification indicates unassigned status
```

**Test Case 5**: Already-completed dependent task
```
1. Mark Task A complete, then Task B (depends on A) complete
2. Mark Task A incomplete (toggle completion)
3. Mark Task A complete again
4. Verify NO notification sent (Task B already done)
```

### Rule 3: Blocker Escalation (P1 - Native Rules)

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (P1)
**Complexity**: Simple (single trigger → notification)
**Platform**: Native Asana Rules
**Estimated Actions/Month**: 20-30 (10 modules × 2-3 blockers average)

#### Business Purpose
Automatically notify Senior Learning Designer (Nicole) when a task is marked with a blocker status, enabling rapid intervention and preventing silent delays.

#### Trigger Logic
**Trigger Type**: Custom field changed event
**Trigger Conditions**: "Blocker Status" custom field set to any value EXCEPT "None"

**Blocker Status Enum Values** (from Agent 1):
1. None (green) - No action
2. Waiting on SME (yellow) - Escalate
3. Waiting on Client (yellow) - Escalate
4. Technical Issue (red) - Escalate
5. Resource Gap (red) - Escalate

#### Action Steps

**Action 1**: Notify Senior Learning Designer
**Notification Content**:
```
Subject: "⚠️ Blocker Alert: [Task Name]"

Body:
"A blocker has been identified on [Task Name]:

Blocker Type: [Blocker Status]
Module: [Module Code] - [Client Name]
Assigned to: [Task Assignee]
Due Date: [Task Due Date]

[Link to Task]

Please review and determine intervention needed."
```

**Action 2**: Add comment to task
```
"🚨 Blocker escalated to Senior LD ([Senior LD Name]) on [Date/Time]"
```

**Action 3**: Increase task priority (optional)
```
Set task priority to "High" (if not already)
```

#### Asana Rule Configuration

**Rule Name**: "Blocker Escalation to Senior LD"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "Blocker Status"
  From: "None"
  To: Any value except "None"

Actions:
  1. Notify specific person:
      Person: Senior LD (Reviewer) [from project custom field]
      Subject: "⚠️ Blocker Alert: {{task.name}}"
      Message: |
        A blocker has been identified:

        Blocker Type: {{task.custom_fields.blocker_status}}
        Module: {{project.custom_fields.module_code}} - {{project.custom_fields.client_name}}
        Task: {{task.name}}
        Assigned to: {{task.assignee}}
        Due: {{task.due_on}}

        Link: {{task.permalink_url}}

  2. Add comment to task:
      Text: "🚨 Blocker escalated to {{project.custom_fields.senior_ld}} on {{now}}"

  3. Update task priority:
      Priority: High
      (Conditional: Only if current priority < High)
```

**Advanced Variant: Blocker Type-Specific Routing**

```yaml
Rule Name: "Blocker: Waiting on SME → Notify Module Author"

Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "Blocker Status"
  To: "Waiting on SME"

Actions:
  1. Notify: Module Author (SME) [from project custom field]
  2. Notify: Senior LD (for visibility)
  3. Add comment: "⏳ Waiting on SME input - {{project.custom_fields.module_author}} notified"
```

```yaml
Rule Name: "Blocker: Technical Issue → Notify Learning Technologist"

Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "Blocker Status"
  To: "Technical Issue"

Actions:
  1. Notify: Learning Technologist [from project custom field]
  2. Notify: Senior LD (for escalation)
  3. Add comment: "🔧 Technical blocker - {{project.custom_fields.learning_technologist}} notified"
```

#### Edge Cases & Validation

**Edge Case 1**: Blocker status changed from one blocker type to another
- **Behavior**: Trigger fires on both FROM and TO values
- **Mitigation**: Rule only triggers when FROM = "None" (initial blocker set)
- **Alternative**: Accept multiple notifications (visibility > noise)

**Edge Case 2**: Blocker resolved (status changed back to "None")
- **Behavior**: No escalation notification (resolution is positive event)
- **Possible Enhancement**: Send "Blocker Resolved" notification to Senior LD (optional, post-pilot)

**Edge Case 3**: Senior LD field not populated in project
- **Behavior**: Notification fails silently OR sends to project owner
- **Mitigation**: Validation rule ensures Senior LD field required (Agent 1 responsibility)
- **Fallback**: Notify project owner if Senior LD field empty

**Edge Case 4**: Multiple blockers on same task
- **Behavior**: Blocker Status is single-select field (only one active blocker type)
- **Validation**: Users must choose primary blocker; secondary issues documented in comments

**Edge Case 5**: Blocker set on completed task
- **Behavior**: Rule triggers, but notification includes completion status
- **Validation**: Likely edge case (completed tasks shouldn't have blockers)
- **Action**: Senior LD investigates potential data issue

#### Testing Plan

**Test Case 1**: Set blocker status to "Waiting on SME"
```
1. Create test task
2. Set "Blocker Status" custom field to "Waiting on SME"
3. Verify Senior LD receives notification
4. Verify task comment added with escalation timestamp
5. Verify task priority increased to "High"
```

**Test Case 2**: Change blocker type (SME → Client)
```
1. Task has "Blocker Status" = "Waiting on SME"
2. Change to "Waiting on Client"
3. Verify notification sent (or not, depending on rule FROM condition)
4. Confirm only one notification per blocker lifecycle
```

**Test Case 3**: Resolve blocker (return to "None")
```
1. Task has blocker "Technical Issue"
2. Change "Blocker Status" to "None"
3. Verify NO escalation notification sent (resolution is expected)
4. Optional: Verify resolution notification if implemented
```

**Test Case 4**: Multiple simultaneous blockers (10 tasks)
```
1. Set blockers on 10 different tasks simultaneously
2. Verify Senior LD receives 10 separate notifications (or batched summary)
3. Confirm all 10 tasks have escalation comments
4. Check automation action count (should be 10)
```

**Test Case 5**: Missing Senior LD field
```
1. Create test project without Senior LD assigned
2. Set blocker on task
3. Verify fallback notification (project owner or error handling)
4. Document guidance for production (Senior LD field required)
```

### Rule 4: QA Approval Gate (P1 - Native Rules)

**Priority**: 🟡 IMPORTANT (P1)
**Complexity**: Moderate (conditional logic + task state change)
**Platform**: Native Asana Rules
**Estimated Actions/Month**: 50-80 (10 modules × 5-8 QA cycles)

#### Business Purpose
Prevent tasks from being marked complete when QA status is "Changes Requested", ensuring quality gates are enforced and rework is completed before progression.

#### Trigger Logic
**Trigger Type**: Task completion attempted
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Task marked complete
- AND "QA Status" custom field = "Changes Requested"

**QA Status Enum Values** (from Agent 1):
1. Not Started (gray) - No gate
2. In Review (yellow) - No gate
3. Changes Requested (red) - **GATE ACTIVE**
4. Approved (green) - No gate

#### Action Steps

**Action 1**: Reopen task (mark incomplete)
```
Set task completion status = Incomplete
```

**Action 2**: Notify task assignee
```
Subject: "❌ Cannot Complete - QA Changes Requested"

Body:
"Your task '[Task Name]' cannot be marked complete because QA feedback requires changes.

QA Status: Changes Requested
Review Comments: [Link to QA review task or comments]

Please address the QA feedback and update QA Status to 'Approved' before completing this task."
```

**Action 3**: Add comment to task
```
"❌ Task completion blocked - QA Status is 'Changes Requested'. Please address QA feedback first."
```

**Action 4**: Optional - Create follow-up task
```
Create task: "Address QA Feedback for [Original Task Name]"
Assign to: Same assignee as original task
Due date: Original task due date - 2 days
Description: "QA review identified changes needed. Please review feedback and update."
```

#### Asana Rule Configuration

**Rule Name**: "QA Approval Gate - Prevent Completion"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Task completed
  Conditions:
    - Custom Field: "QA Status"
    - Value: "Changes Requested"

Actions:
  1. Mark task incomplete:
      (Asana rule action: "Reopen task" or "Mark incomplete")

  2. Notify assignee:
      Subject: "❌ Cannot Complete - QA Changes Requested"
      Message: |
        Your task cannot be marked complete due to outstanding QA feedback.

        Task: {{task.name}}
        QA Status: Changes Requested

        Please review QA comments and address feedback before completing.

        {{task.permalink_url}}

  3. Add comment to task:
      Text: "❌ Task completion blocked on {{now}} - QA Status is 'Changes Requested'. Address feedback and update QA Status to 'Approved' before completing."

  4. Set due date reminder:
      Reminder: 1 day before original due date
      (Conditional: If not already set)
```

**Companion Rule**: "QA Approved - Allow Completion"

```yaml
Rule Name: "QA Approved Notification"

Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "QA Status"
  From: "Changes Requested"
  To: "Approved"

Actions:
  1. Notify assignee:
      Message: "✅ QA feedback addressed - You can now complete {{task.name}}"

  2. Add comment to task:
      Text: "✅ QA approved on {{now}} - Task ready for completion"
```

#### Edge Cases & Validation

**Edge Case 1**: Task has no QA Status field (field not applicable)
- **Behavior**: Rule does not trigger (condition not met)
- **Validation**: Rule only applies to tasks with QA Status field populated

**Edge Case 2**: User forces completion via API or mobile app
- **Behavior**: Rule may not trigger if API/mobile bypasses Asana web UI rules
- **Mitigation**: Document that QA gate enforcement relies on Asana rule system
- **Fallback**: Manual review by Senior LD catches violations

**Edge Case 3**: QA Status changed from "Changes Requested" to "Approved" after task completed
- **Behavior**: Task remains complete (retroactive approval)
- **Validation**: Acceptable workflow - approval after completion is valid

**Edge Case 4**: QA reviewer sets status to "In Review" instead of "Approved"
- **Behavior**: Gate does not prevent completion ("In Review" is not "Changes Requested")
- **Guidance**: QA reviewer training - use "Approved" to clear gate

**Edge Case 5**: Multiple QA cycles (re-review after corrections)
- **Behavior**: Each "Changes Requested" → "Approved" cycle triggers notifications
- **Validation**: Acceptable - each cycle is distinct QA event

#### Testing Plan

**Test Case 1**: Attempt to complete task with "Changes Requested" status
```
1. Create test task
2. Set "QA Status" = "Changes Requested"
3. Mark task complete
4. Verify task automatically reopened (marked incomplete)
5. Verify assignee receives notification
6. Verify task comment added
```

**Test Case 2**: Complete task with "Approved" status
```
1. Create test task
2. Set "QA Status" = "Approved"
3. Mark task complete
4. Verify task REMAINS complete (no gate triggered)
5. Verify no blocking notification sent
```

**Test Case 3**: QA status progression (Changes → Approved → Complete)
```
1. Task has "QA Status" = "Changes Requested"
2. Attempt to complete → Verify blocked
3. Change "QA Status" to "Approved"
4. Verify "QA Approved" notification sent
5. Mark task complete → Verify successful completion
```

**Test Case 4**: Task with no QA Status field
```
1. Create task without "QA Status" field populated
2. Mark task complete
3. Verify completion successful (no QA gate applies)
4. Confirm rule does not trigger on empty field
```

**Test Case 5**: Rapid toggling (complete → incomplete → complete)
```
1. Mark task complete with "Changes Requested" status
2. Verify reopened
3. Immediately try to complete again (status unchanged)
4. Verify reopened again
5. Change status to "Approved"
6. Complete successfully
```

### Rule 5: Launch Date Change Notification (P1 - Native Rules)

**Priority**: 🟡 IMPORTANT (P1)
**Complexity**: Simple (single trigger → notification)
**Platform**: Native Asana Rules
**Limitation**: **NOTIFICATION ONLY** - Does NOT recalculate task dates (per Agent 2 findings)
**Estimated Actions/Month**: 5-10 (10 modules × 0.5-1 launch date change average)

#### Business Purpose
Alert all project members when the "Launch Date" custom field is modified, signaling that the project timeline has changed and manual date recalculation (via API script) may be required.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT**: Per Agent 2's research findings, Asana native rules CANNOT automatically recalculate task dates when a custom "Launch Date" field changes. This rule serves as a notification trigger only. Actual date recalculation must be performed via API script (Agent 2's `apply_task_dates.py` or template instantiation script).

#### Trigger Logic
**Trigger Type**: Custom field changed event
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Custom Field: "Launch Date" (Date field)
- Value: Changed (from any value to any different value)

#### Action Steps

**Action 1**: Notify all project members
```
Subject: "🔄 Launch Date Changed for [Module Code]"

Body:
"The Launch Date for this module has been updated.

Previous Launch Date: [Old Value]
New Launch Date: [New Value]
Change Made By: [User who changed field]
Change Date: [Timestamp]

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Task dates are NOT automatically recalculated.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Review all task due dates in the Timeline view
2. Contact the project coordinator to run date recalculation script
3. Notify external stakeholders (Client, SME) of timeline change

[Link to Project Timeline]"
```

**Action 2**: Add comment to project
```
"🔄 Launch Date changed from [Old Value] to [New Value] by [User] on [Date/Time]

⚠️ Task dates require manual recalculation via API script. Contact project coordinator."
```

**Action 3**: Tag project as "Timeline Updated"
```
Add project tag: "Timeline Updated" (for filtering/reporting)
```

**Action 4**: Optional - Create follow-up task for coordinator
```
Create task: "Recalculate Task Dates for New Launch Date"
Assign to: Project Coordinator or Senior LD
Due: Today + 1 day
Description: |
  Launch date changed to [New Launch Date].

  ACTION: Run API script to recalculate all task dates:
  python apply_task_dates.py --project [Project GID] --launch-date [New Launch Date]

  Verify all 72 task dates updated correctly.
```

#### Asana Rule Configuration

**Rule Name**: "Launch Date Change Notification"

```yaml
Trigger:
  Type: Custom field changed
  Custom Field: "Launch Date"
  From: Any value
  To: Different value

Actions:
  1. Notify project members:
      Subject: "🔄 Launch Date Changed for {{project.custom_fields.module_code}}"
      Message: |
        The Launch Date has been updated:

        Previous: {{trigger.custom_field.old_value}}
        New: {{trigger.custom_field.new_value}}
        Changed by: {{trigger.user}}

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Task dates are NOT automatically recalculated.

        ACTION REQUIRED:
        1. Review Timeline view for date impacts
        2. Contact project coordinator to run date recalculation script
        3. Notify external stakeholders (Client, SME) of timeline change

        Project: {{project.permalink_url}}

  2. Add comment to project:
      Text: "🔄 Launch Date changed from {{trigger.custom_field.old_value}} to {{trigger.custom_field.new_value}} by {{trigger.user}} on {{now}}\n\n⚠️ Task dates require manual recalculation via API script."

  3. Add project tag:
      Tag: "Timeline Updated"

  4. Create follow-up task:
      Name: "Recalculate Task Dates for New Launch Date"
      Assignee: {{project.custom_fields.senior_ld}}
      Due date: {{now + 1 day}}
      Description: |
        Launch date changed to {{trigger.custom_field.new_value}}.

        ACTION: Run API script to recalculate all 72 task dates:
        python apply_task_dates.py --project {{project.gid}} --launch-date {{trigger.custom_field.new_value}}

        Verify all task dates updated correctly in Timeline view.
      Section: "Initiation"
```

#### Edge Cases & Validation

**Edge Case 1**: Launch Date set for first time (from blank to date)
- **Behavior**: Rule triggers (blank → value is a change)
- **Validation**: Notification appropriate (initial timeline establishment)

**Edge Case 2**: Launch Date cleared (set to blank)
- **Behavior**: Rule triggers (value → blank is a change)
- **Notification**: "Launch Date removed" warning (critical issue)
- **Action**: Escalate to Senior LD immediately

**Edge Case 3**: Rapid successive changes (user correcting typo)
- **Behavior**: Each change triggers separate notification
- **Mitigation**: Acceptable (transparency > noise reduction)
- **Alternative**: Debounce rule (1-minute delay before notification - Advanced tier feature)

**Edge Case 4**: Launch Date changed but task dates already recalculated manually
- **Behavior**: Notification still sent (rule cannot detect manual recalculation)
- **Validation**: User can acknowledge and close follow-up task if already done

**Edge Case 5**: Multiple projects (modules) with same launch date
- **Behavior**: Each project rule fires independently (no cross-project impact)
- **Validation**: Correct behavior (each module has independent timeline)

#### Testing Plan

**Test Case 1**: Change launch date from one date to another
```
1. Set "Launch Date" custom field to "2025-11-15"
2. Change to "2025-12-01"
3. Verify all project members receive notification
4. Verify notification includes old value (2025-11-15) and new value (2025-12-01)
5. Verify project comment added with change details
6. Verify "Timeline Updated" tag added to project
7. Verify follow-up task created and assigned to Senior LD
```

**Test Case 2**: Set launch date for first time (blank → date)
```
1. Create test project with blank "Launch Date" field
2. Set "Launch Date" to "2025-11-20"
3. Verify notification sent (initial date establishment)
4. Verify notification acknowledges this is first-time setting
```

**Test Case 3**: Clear launch date (date → blank)
```
1. Project has "Launch Date" = "2025-11-15"
2. Clear field (set to blank)
3. Verify critical notification sent ("Launch Date removed")
4. Verify escalation to Senior LD
5. Verify project tagged for urgent review
```

**Test Case 4**: Rapid successive changes (within 5 minutes)
```
1. Change "Launch Date" from A to B
2. Immediately change from B to C
3. Change from C to D
4. Verify 3 separate notifications sent (no debouncing for pilot)
5. Document if notification noise becomes issue (post-pilot enhancement)
```

**Test Case 5**: Change date, then manually recalculate dates via script
```
1. Change "Launch Date" to new value
2. Verify notification sent
3. Manually run API script to recalculate dates
4. Mark follow-up task complete
5. Verify workflow completes correctly
6. Confirm no duplicate notifications
```

## SECTION 2: INTEGRATION WITH AGENT 1 & 2 DELIVERABLES

### Integration Point 1: Custom Field Dependencies (Agent 1)

**Required Custom Fields** (from Agent 1 deliverable):

| Rule | Custom Field Required | Field Type | Enum Values Needed | GID Reference |
|------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Rule 1 | Module Status | Single Select | Planning, In Development, Build, QA, Ready, Launched, Archived | TBD (Agent 1 Phase 1A) |
| Rule 2 | (No custom fields) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Rule 3 | Blocker Status | Single Select | None, Waiting on SME, Waiting on Client, Technical Issue, Resource Gap | TBD (Agent 1 Phase 1B) |
| Rule 3 | Senior LD (Reviewer) | Person | N/A | TBD (Agent 1 Phase 1A) |
| Rule 4 | QA Status | Single Select | Not Started, In Review, Changes Requested, Approved | TBD (Agent 1 Phase 1B) |
| Rule 5 | Launch Date | Date | N/A | TBD (Agent 1 Phase 1A) |

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Rule 1 (Module Status Propagation): BLOCKED until "Module Status" custom field created
- Rule 3 (Blocker Escalation): BLOCKED until "Blocker Status" + "Senior LD" fields created
- Rule 4 (QA Approval Gate): BLOCKED until "QA Status" custom field created
- Rule 5 (Launch Date Notification): BLOCKED until "Launch Date" custom field created

**Validation Checkpoint**: Before configuring automation rules, verify all 5 required custom fields exist with correct enum values.

### Integration Point 2: API Script Coordination (Agent 2)

**Agent 2 Finding**: Native Asana CANNOT anchor task dates to custom "Launch Date" field

**Impact on Rule 5**:
- Rule 5 is **notification-only** (cannot trigger automatic date recalculation)
- Manual workflow required: Launch Date change → Run API script → Dates recalculated
- API script: `apply_task_dates.py` (existing) or `create_module_from_template.py` (new)

**Coordination Workflow**:
```
1. User changes "Launch Date" custom field in Asana UI
2. Rule 5 triggers:
   - Notify team
   - Create follow-up task: "Recalculate Task Dates"
   - Assign to project coordinator or Senior LD
3. Coordinator runs API script:
   python apply_task_dates.py --project [GID] --launch-date [New Date]
4. Script recalculates all 72 task dates relative to new launch date
5. Coordinator marks follow-up task complete
6. Team reviews updated Timeline view
```

**Post-Pilot Enhancement Opportunity**:
- Investigate Asana webhooks to trigger API script automatically on Launch Date change
- Requires: Webhook listener service (e.g., n8n, Zapier, custom server)
- Benefit: Eliminate manual script execution step
- Complexity: Medium-High (infrastructure setup + error handling)

**Total Action Budget**: ~100 actions (well within 25,000/month limit)

### Integration Testing

**End-to-End Workflow Test**:
```
Scenario: Complete module development workflow with all automation rules active

1. Create test module from template
2. Set Launch Date → Verify Rule 5 triggers
3. Complete MPD → Verify Rule 1 updates Module Status to "In Development"
4. Complete Week 1 Storyboard → Verify Rule 2 notifies Week 1 Build assignee
5. Set blocker "Waiting on SME" on Week 2 task → Verify Rule 3 escalates to Senior LD
6. Mark Week 1 Build complete with QA Status "Changes Requested" → Verify Rule 4 blocks completion
7. Change QA Status to "Approved" → Complete Week 1 Build successfully
8. Advance through all phases → Verify Rule 1 progresses Module Status to "Ready"
9. Change Launch Date → Verify Rule 5 notification + follow-up task created
10. Validate automation action count < 25 actions for entire module workflow

Success Criteria:
- All 5 rules triggered at appropriate times
- No false positives (rules triggering when they shouldn't)
- No missed triggers (rules not firing when they should)
- Notifications received by correct people
- Task states updated correctly
- Automation action budget reasonable (<500 actions/module)
```

### Performance & Monitoring

**Automation Action Monitoring**:
- Track daily action count via Asana Admin Console
- Alert threshold: 20,000 actions/month (80% of limit)
- Critical threshold: 24,000 actions/month (96% of limit)

**Expected Pilot Usage** (10 modules):
- Module Status changes: 10 modules × 8 transitions × 2 actions = 160 actions/month
- Next Resource notifications: 10 modules × 50 handoffs × 1 action = 500 actions/month
- Blocker escalations: 10 modules × 3 blockers × 3 actions = 90 actions/month
- QA approval gates: 10 modules × 8 QA cycles × 2 actions = 160 actions/month
- Launch date changes: 10 modules × 1 change × 5 actions = 50 actions/month
- **Total Estimated**: ~1,000 actions/month (4% of 25,000 limit)

**Contingency Plan**: If action limit reached, prioritize rules by P0/P1 and disable Rule 5 temporarily (least critical).

## SECTION 4: TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

### User Guide: Understanding Automation Rules

**For Team Members**: What to Expect from Automated Workflows

#### Rule 1: Module Status Propagation
**What it does**: Automatically updates the module's overall status when you complete key milestone tasks.

**When it triggers**:
- Complete "MPD Completion" → Status becomes "In Development"
- Complete "Week 8 Storyboard to Client" → Status becomes "Build"
- Complete "Ready for Academic Review" → Status becomes "QA"
- Complete "Corrections and Uploading to VLE" → Status becomes "Ready"

**What you'll see**:
- Project comment: "✅ Module status updated to [New Status] - [Trigger Task] completed"
- Notification to all project members

**What you should do**:
- No action required - this is informational
- Review project status in Portfolio Dashboard if needed

#### Rule 2: Next Resource Notification
**What it does**: Notifies you when a task you're assigned to is ready to begin (all dependencies complete).

**When it triggers**:
- A task you're assigned to becomes actionable (all predecessor tasks done)

**What you'll see**:
- Email/Asana notification: "Your task is now ready: [Task Name]"
- Notification includes task link, due date, and who completed the predecessor task

**What you should do**:
- Click the task link to review details
- Begin work on the task (it's now unblocked)
- Update task status or add comments as you progress

#### Rule 3: Blocker Escalation
**What it does**: Alerts the Senior Learning Designer (Nicole) when you mark a task as blocked.

**When it triggers**:
- You set the "Blocker Status" field to anything other than "None"

**What you'll see**:
- Task comment: "🚨 Blocker escalated to [Senior LD] on [Date/Time]"
- Task priority may increase to "High"

**What you should do**:
- Add a detailed comment explaining the blocker (what's blocking you, what you need)
- Wait for Senior LD intervention or guidance
- Update "Blocker Status" back to "None" once resolved

**Senior LD will receive**:
- Immediate notification with blocker type and task details

#### Rule 4: QA Approval Gate
**What it does**: Prevents you from marking a task complete if QA has requested changes.

**When it triggers**:
- You try to mark a task complete while "QA Status" = "Changes Requested"

**What you'll see**:
- Task automatically reopens (unchecks completion)
- Notification: "❌ Cannot Complete - QA Changes Requested"
- Task comment explaining the block

**What you should do**:
1. Review QA feedback (check task comments or linked QA review task)
2. Address all requested changes
3. Update "QA Status" field to "Approved" (or ask QA reviewer to approve)
4. Now you can mark the task complete

#### Rule 5: Launch Date Change Notification
**What it does**: Alerts everyone when the module's Launch Date is changed.

**When it triggers**:
- Someone changes the "Launch Date" custom field on the project

**What you'll see**:
- Notification: "🔄 Launch Date Changed for [Module Code]"
- Details include old date, new date, who changed it
- **Important warning**: Task dates are NOT automatically updated

**What you should do**:
1. Review the Timeline view to see date impacts
2. Contact the project coordinator if you notice date conflicts
3. Wait for confirmation that task dates have been recalculated (via API script)
4. Notify external stakeholders (Client, SME) of timeline change if needed

**Project Coordinator will**:
- Receive follow-up task to run date recalculation script
- Update all 72 task dates via API
- Confirm with team when dates are updated

## SECTION 5: POST-PILOT EXPANSION ROADMAP

### Phase 4: Enhanced Automation Rules (Post-Pilot - Week 8-10)

**After pilot validation (10 modules, mid-late November)**, evaluate expansion opportunities:

#### Tier 2 Rules (Medium Priority)

**Rule 6: Film Shoot Workflow Automation**
- **Trigger**: Task "Film Shoot Script Complete" marked done
- **Actions**:
  - Create task: "Book Film Shoot Resources"
  - Assign to: Learning Technologist
  - Set due date: Script complete date + 5 days
  - Notify: Module Author (SME) to coordinate schedule
- **Value**: Automates 2-week film shoot coordination workflow
- **Complexity**: Medium (task creation + multi-person notification)

**Rule 7: Academic Review Batch Grouping**
- **Trigger**: Task "Week 1 and 2 review" created
- **Actions**:
  - Set "Review Batch" custom field to "Weeks 1-2"
  - Create task: "Prepare Week 1-2 Review Bundle"
  - Link to: All Week 1-2 storyboard tasks
- **Value**: Groups reviews for efficient client coordination
- **Complexity**: Medium (multi-task linking)

**Rule 8: Resource Over-Allocation Detection**
- **Trigger**: Person assigned to >3 tasks with same due date
- **Actions**:
  - Notify: Senior LD
  - Add comment to each task: "⚠️ Resource potentially over-allocated on this date"
  - Tag project: "Resource Conflict"
- **Value**: Prevents burnout, enables proactive resource reallocation
- **Complexity**: High (requires cross-task analysis - may need AI Studio or API)

**Rule 9: Overdue Task Escalation**
- **Trigger**: Task becomes overdue
- **Actions**:
  - Immediate: Notify task assignee
  - After 1 day: Notify Senior LD
  - After 3 days: Add to "At Risk Modules" portfolio, set priority "High"
- **Value**: Prevents silent delays, enables early intervention
- **Complexity**: Medium (time-based triggers + multi-stage notifications)

**Rule 10: Dependency Cycle Detection**
- **Trigger**: Dependency added that creates circular reference
- **Actions**:
  - Reject dependency creation
  - Notify: User attempting to create dependency
  - Alert: Senior LD (potential template issue)
- **Value**: Maintains template integrity, prevents workflow gridlock
- **Complexity**: High (requires dependency graph analysis - likely API-based)

#### Tier 3 Rules (Low Priority / Nice-to-Have)

**Rule 11: Content Type Reminder**
- **Trigger**: Week N Storyboard task created
- **Action**: Remind assignee to set "Content Type" multi-select field
- **Value**: Ensures content metadata populated for reporting
- **Complexity**: Low

**Rule 12: Estimated Hours Rollup**
- **Trigger**: Task marked complete
- **Action**: Update project-level "Total Hours Spent" calculated field
- **Value**: Enables capacity planning and ROI analysis
- **Complexity**: Medium (calculated field + aggregation)

**Rule 13: Client Notification Trigger**
- **Trigger**: Task requiring client input becomes ready
- **Action**: Send email to client contact (via integration)
- **Value**: Reduces manual coordination overhead
- **Complexity**: High (requires email integration - Zapier/n8n)

**Rule 14: Automated Progress Reporting**
- **Trigger**: Weekly (every Friday at 5pm)
- **Action**: Generate progress summary report, send to Senior LD
- **Value**: Provides weekly pulse on all modules
- **Complexity**: High (requires reporting API + scheduled trigger)

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Advanced Automation (Post-Pilot - Week 12+)

**Long-Term Enhancements** (require significant development):

**AI Studio Advanced Workflows**:
1. **Smart Dependency Suggestion**: AI analyzes task descriptions, suggests likely dependencies
2. **Deadline Risk Prediction**: ML model predicts tasks at risk of delay based on historical data
3. **Resource Allocation Optimization**: AI recommends resource assignments based on capacity + skills
4. **Automated QA Checklist Generation**: AI generates task-specific QA criteria based on content type

**API-Based Custom Automation**:
1. **Webhook-Triggered Date Recalculation**: Launch Date change → Automatic API script execution (no manual step)
2. **Cross-Project Portfolio Analytics**: Aggregate data across all modules for portfolio dashboard
3. **Client Portal Integration**: Sync review tasks to client-facing portal (external system)
4. **VLE Integration**: Automatically update VLE when "Go Live Date" reached

**Evaluation Criteria for Expansion**:
- Pilot feedback: Do rules save time or create noise?
- Action budget: Are we approaching 25,000/month limit?
- User adoption: Are team members relying on automation or bypassing it?
- ROI: Does automation reduce module setup time from 60 min → target 10 min?

---

## SECTION 6: RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Automation Action Limit Exceeded
**Probability**: Low (pilot usage ~1,000/month vs 25,000 limit)
**Impact**: Medium (rules stop firing, silent failures)

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor daily action count via Asana Admin Console
- Set alert at 20,000 actions/month (80% threshold)
- Prioritization plan: Disable Rule 5 first (lowest impact), then Rule 2 (highest action volume)
- Upgrade to Enterprise tier if sustained high usage (unlimited actions)

### Risk 2: Rule Trigger False Positives
**Probability**: Medium (edge cases in complex workflows)
**Impact**: Low (notification noise, not data corruption)

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive testing before pilot launch (Section 3)
- User training on expected rule behavior (Section 4)
- Feedback mechanism: "Report Automation Issue" task template
- Iterative refinement: Adjust rule conditions based on pilot feedback

### Risk 3: Custom Field Dependencies Not Met
**Probability**: High (Agent 1 custom fields must be created first)
**Impact**: Critical (rules cannot be configured without fields)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear dependency documentation (Section 2 Integration Points)
- Phased rollout: Agent 1 Phase 1A → Configure Rules 1,5 → Agent 1 Phase 1B → Configure Rules 3,4
- Validation checkpoint: Test custom field accessibility before rule configuration

### Risk 4: AI Studio Unavailable or Limited
**Probability**: Medium (AI Studio documentation limited, capabilities uncertain)
**Impact**: Medium (Rule 2 coverage reduced to 10 key handoffs instead of full dependency network)

**Mitigation**:
- Fallback: Native Rules variant for Rule 2 (10 handoff rules instead of 1 AI workflow)
- Pilot testing of AI Studio during setup phase
- Alternative: API-based dependency notification script (custom development)

### Risk 5: User Confusion or Training Gaps
**Probability**: Medium (automation behavior may be unexpected for users unfamiliar with rules)
**Impact**: Low (users may manually duplicate automated actions or ignore notifications)

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive user guide (Section 4 Training Documentation)
- Demo session during Tuesday meeting (Phase 5 of original implementation plan)
- Onboarding checklist for new team members
- FAQ document addressing common questions

### Risk 6: Launch Date Recalculation Workflow Friction
**Probability**: High (Rule 5 requires manual API script execution)
**Impact**: Medium (coordinator overhead, potential for forgotten recalculation)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear notification messaging (Rule 5 includes API script instructions)
- Follow-up task creation (ensures coordinator accountable)
- Post-pilot enhancement: Webhook automation (eliminate manual step)
- Fallback: Accept manual recalculation for pilot (low launch date change frequency)

---

## SECTION 7: SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

### Long-Term KPIs (Post-Pilot - 6 Months)

**Scalability**:
- Automation supports 50+ active modules without action limit breach
- Rule configuration time <30 minutes for new module type variations
- Team self-sufficiency: >80% of rule modifications handled without developer support

**ROI**:
- Module setup time: 60 minutes (manual) → <15 minutes (automated)
- Coordination overhead: 5 hours/week (manual status updates + notifications) → <1 hour/week
- Senior LD intervention time: <30 minutes/module (faster escalation via Rule 3)

**Quality**:
- QA rework rate: <10% of tasks require QA re-review (Rule 4 prevention)
- Timeline accuracy: >95% of modules launch within ±3 days of original launch date (Rule 5 visibility)
- Blocker resolution time: <48 hours average (Rule 3 escalation speed)
