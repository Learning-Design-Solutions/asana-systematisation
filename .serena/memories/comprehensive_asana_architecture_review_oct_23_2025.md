## WHAT REMAINS INCOMPLETE ❌

### Critical Path Blockers (MUST DO BEFORE PHASE 2)

**Feature 1: Custom Fields System** [BLOCKER]
- **Status**: 31 fields specified, 0 created in workspace
- **Impact Blocked**: Portfolio dashboard queries, relative date anchoring, automation rules, resource allocation
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
  - Field creation (2 hours)
  - Enum value definition (1 hour)
  - GID documentation for API use (1 hour)
  - API population + validation (1-2 hours)
- **Phase**: Phase 1 (Week 1-2)
- **Must-Have First**: Core 10 fields (Module Code, Client Name, Programme Name, Launch Date, Go Live Date, Learning Designer, Learning Technologist, Senior LD, Module Author, Module Status)

**Feature 2: Relative Date Anchoring Formula** [BLOCKER]
- **Status**: Not implemented, Asana Premium capability unknown
- **Impact Blocked**: Template reusability, automatic date recalculation on launch date change
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
  - Create "Launch Date" custom field (included in Feature 1)
  - Implement relative date formulas (3 hours)
  - Test date recalculation (2 hours)
  - Validate all 72 tasks update correctly (1 hour)
- **Phase**: Phase 1 (Week 1-2)
- **Risk**: Asana Premium may not support relative dates anchored to custom fields
- **Fallback**: API-based date calculation script for template instantiation

### High Priority (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)

**Feature 3: Template Conversion for Production** [HIGH PRIORITY]
- **Status**: Test project remains regular project, not template
- **Impact**: Cannot duplicate for new modules yet
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours (Phase 2, Week 2-3)
- **Prerequisite**: Phase 1 complete (custom fields + relative dates)
- **Includes**: Clean up placeholder tasks, convert to template, test duplication

**Feature 4: Critical Automation Rules** [HIGH PRIORITY]
- **Status**: Zero automation rules configured (15+ specified)
- **Missing**:
  - Status propagation (section complete → module status update)
  - Next resource notification (task complete → notify dependent task assignee)
  - Blocker escalation (blocker status → notify Senior LD)
  - QA approval gate (prevent completion with open QA issues)
  - Launch date change notification (launch date modified → notify team)
- **Effort**: 8-10 hours (Phase 3, Week 3-4)
- **Priority Order**: Start with 5 critical rules, expand based on feedback

**Feature 5: Pilot Module & Team Training** [CRITICAL FOR ADOPTION]
- **Status**: No pilot module selected, no training materials created
- **Effort**: 12-16 hours (Phase 5, Week 5-7)
- **Includes**: Pilot setup, training decks, training sessions, feedback gathering, template iteration

### Medium Priority (TRACK 1 PHASE 2 PREREQUISITE)

**Feature 6: Portfolio Structure Implementation**
- **Status**: Architecture designed (Track 1 Phase 1), not implemented
- **Includes**: Custom fields, test programmes, portfolio query validation
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours (Phase 4, Week 4-5)
- **Prerequisite**: Phase 1 custom fields

**Feature 7: Google Workspace Integration** (Track 1 Phase 2)
- **Status**: Not started
- **Includes**: Google Sheets dashboard, Google Docs reports, Gmail distribution
- **Effort**: 12-16 hours (Phase 6, Week 7-10)
- **Deliverables**: Automated weekly portfolio dashboard, status reports, email distribution

### Low Priority (LONGER TERM)

**Feature 8: Resource Allocation**
- **Status**: Custom fields designed, not created
- **Includes**: LDS Resource, Client Resource fields, workload views
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours (Phase 1-4)

**Feature 9: Documentation & Training**
- **Status**: Specification comprehensive, user guides needed
- **Includes**: "How to Use Template" guide, training slides, FAQ, demo video
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours (Phase 5)

**Feature 10: Integration with Other Workflows** (Workflow 5, 6, 7, 8)
- **Status**: Architecture designed, implementation not started
- **Impact**: Long-term system completeness
- **Effort**: 60-80 hours (Phase 8, Month 4-6)

## CRITICAL DECISIONS REQUIRING ANDREW INPUT

**Decision 1: Custom Field Scope**
- Create all 31 fields? Start with 10 core? Create on-demand?
- **Recommendation**: Start with 10 core fields (Phase 1), expand incrementally

**Decision 2: Relative Date Implementation**
- Native Asana relative dates? API-based script? Hybrid approach?
- **Recommendation**: Try native Asana first, fallback to API script if limited

**Decision 3: Automation Rule Scope**
- All 15 rules? 5 critical rules? Manual workflow?
- **Recommendation**: 5 critical rules first (Phase 3), expand based on feedback

**Decision 4: Template Conversion Timing**
- Convert now? After Phase 1? After Phase 1-2?
- **Recommendation**: After Phase 1-2 (custom fields + relative dates must work first)

**Decision 5: Pilot Module Selection**
- Which module to use for pilot? Timing?
- **Recommendation**: Module starting in 4-6 weeks with engaged SME

**Decision 6: Portfolio Structure Complexity**
- Which programme structure? How many custom fields?
- **Recommendation**: Start simple (1-2 programmes), expand as needed

**Decision 7: Automation Rule Complexity**
- Simple status updates? Complex cascading rules?
- **Recommendation**: Start simple (5 rules), add complexity based on pain points

**Decision 8: Film Shoot Applicability**
- All modules or selective? How to control?
- **Recommendation**: All templates by default, control via "Media Requirements" custom field

**Decision 9: Academic Reviewer Consistency**
- Prevent changes (hard block)? Alert on change (warning)?
- **Recommendation**: Alert on change + task description warning (balances control with flexibility)

**Decision 10: Launch Buffer Flexibility**
- Fixed 66 days? Configurable per module? Per programme?
- **Recommendation**: Configurable "Days to Go Live" custom field per module

## QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Strengths ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

1. **Hybrid Approach**: CSV import (speed) + API (power) = best of both
2. **Proven Foundation**: Based on actual Walbrook client use, not theory
3. **Preserves Investment**: All work to date remains valid, no rebuilding needed
4. **Clear Architecture**: Separation of concerns (structure, relationships, timeline, automation)
5. **Scalable Portfolio Design**: Supports 3-5 programmes, 10-20 modules
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 87-page spec with every detail documented
7. **Realistic Timeline**: Andrew's feedback integrated throughout
8. **Dependency Enforcement**: 52 dependencies prevent quality issues
9. **API-First Approach**: Repeatable, automatable, version-controllable
10. **Phase-Based Implementation**: Reduces risk, enables iteration

### Gaps ⚠️

1. **Custom Fields**: 31 specified, 0 created (blocker for Phases 2+)
2. **Relative Dates**: Feasibility unknown (may require API script fallback)
3. **Automation Rules**: 15 specified, 0 configured (manual work remains)
4. **Portfolio Structure**: Designed (45 pages), not implemented
5. **Template Not Converted**: Still regular project, not template
6. **No Training Materials**: Team will need guides and training

### Sustainability ✅✅✅

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Spec + implementation summaries enable future maintainability
- **API-First**: All operations repeatable, not manual clicking
- **Incremental Design**: Phase 1-8 supports evolution without disruption
- **Real-World Proven**: Based on Walbrook client usage
- **Team Adoption**: Pilot testing, training, feedback loops built in
