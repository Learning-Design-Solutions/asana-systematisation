## SECTION 1: PILOT TIMELINE & MILESTONES

### Timeline Analysis (--think flag reasoning)

**Reasoning: Why 3 weeks?**
- **Week 1 (Nov 15-21)**: Setup and initial validation phase
  - Day 1-2: Custom fields verification and template deployment
  - Day 3-5: Automation rules testing and initial user training
  - Critical milestone: All infrastructure deployed and operational

- **Week 2 (Nov 22-28)**: Active usage and feedback collection
  - Real-world module creation from template (2-3 modules)
  - Automation rules triggering in production scenarios
  - First structured feedback session (Wed Nov 27)
  - Critical milestone: Automation working reliably, no blocking issues

- **Week 3 (Nov 29-Dec 5)**: Evaluation and iteration
  - Complete remaining pilot modules (remaining 7-8 modules)
  - Second structured feedback session (Wed Dec 4)

### Critical Path Dependencies

**Phase Dependencies** (must complete in order):
1. **Agent 1 Phase 1A** → Custom fields created → Week 1 Day 1 infrastructure verification
2. **Agent 4 Automation Rules** → Rules deployed → Week 1 Day 1-2 automation testing
3. **Week 1 Infrastructure** → Template ready → Week 1 Day 3+ module creation
4. **Week 2 Real-World Usage** → Data collected → Week 3 evaluation analysis
5. **Week 3 Evaluation** → Decision made → Broader rollout planning (Phase 6)

**Blocker Resolution Plan**:
- If Agent 1 Phase 1A incomplete by Nov 15 → Delay pilot kickoff 1 week
- If automation rules fail testing Week 1 → Pause module creation, fix critical issues
- If >3 blocking issues Week 1 → Extend pilot to 4 weeks (add 1 week buffer)
- If pilot shows critical flaws → No-Go decision, return to design phase

### Daily Monitoring (Lightweight, Asynchronous)

**No Daily Meetings** - Use asynchronous monitoring to avoid coordinator overhead

**Daily Monitoring Mechanisms**:

1. **"Pilot Feedback" Task Template**:
   - Created in each pilot module project
   - Users comment with issues, questions, observations
   - Coordinator reviews once per day (15 min)
   - Format: [Issue Type] Description (e.g., "[Automation] Rule 2 didn't fire for Week 1 Build handoff")

2. **Asana Admin Console**:
   - Check automation action count daily (5 min)
   - Alert threshold: >150 actions/day (potential runaway rule)
   - Track cumulative usage vs 25,000/month budget

3. **Slack Channel: #asana-pilot**:
   - Quick questions and urgent issues
   - Coordinator monitors 2-3 times per day
   - Use threads to keep discussions organized

4. **Module Creation Log** (Google Sheet):
   - Users log each module creation:
     - Module Code, Creation Date, Time Taken, Issues Encountered
   - Coordinator reviews weekly for metrics analysis

**Escalation Path**:
- **Urgent Issues** (blocking work): Slack mention @coordinator immediately
- **High Priority** (impacts quality): Comment on "Pilot Feedback" task
- **Low Priority** (nice-to-have): Wait for weekly check-in discussion

## SECTION 4: FEEDBACK COLLECTION STRATEGY

### Structured Feedback Mechanisms

**Mechanism 1: Weekly User Satisfaction Survey** (5 min per user)

**Survey Questions** (5-point Likert scale: Strongly Agree → Strongly Disagree):

1. **Automation Rules**:
   - "Automation rules save me time compared to manual status updates"
   - "Notifications from automation rules are relevant, not noise"
   - "I understand when and why automation rules trigger"

2. **Template Workflow**:
   - "Creating a module from template is faster than manual setup"
   - "Custom fields are intuitive and useful for tracking module progress"
   - "Template dependencies correctly reflect our real workflow"

3. **Training & Documentation**:
   - "Training materials prepared me to use the template effectively"
   - "User guide answered my questions about template usage"
   - "I know where to report issues or ask questions"

4. **Overall Experience**:
   - "I would recommend this system to other teams" (Yes / No / Maybe)
   - "The pilot has been a valuable use of my time" (Yes / No / Maybe)

**Open-Ended Questions**:
- "What is the #1 thing that worked well this week?"
- "What is the #1 pain point or frustration this week?"
- "What would you improve for broader rollout?"

**Timing**: End of Week 1 (Fri Nov 19), End of Week 2 (Fri Nov 26), End of Week 3 (Wed Dec 3)

**Mechanism 4: Automation Rule Effectiveness Tracking**

**Tracking Spreadsheet** (Google Sheets, updated weekly):

| Rule | Trigger Event | Expected Behavior | Week 1 Triggers | Week 2 Triggers | Week 3 Triggers | False Positives | Missed Triggers | Effectiveness Rating (1-5) |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Rule 1: Module Status Propagation | Task completion | Status updates | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Rule 2: Next Resource Notification | Task completion | Assignee notified | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Rule 3: Blocker Escalation | Blocker status set | Senior LD notified | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Rule 4: QA Approval Gate | Task completion with "Changes Requested" | Task auto-reopens | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Rule 5: Launch Date Change | Launch Date modified | Team notified + follow-up task | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Data Sources**:
- Asana Admin Console (automation action count)
- User reports ("Pilot Feedback" task comments)
- Coordinator observations

**Analysis Questions**:
- Which rules triggered most frequently? (expected usage)
- Which rules had highest false positive rate? (noise concern)
- Which rules missed triggers? (reliability concern)
- Which rules provided most value? (user feedback)

---

### Feedback Synthesis Process

**Weekly Synthesis** (Coordinator activity, 1 hour each week):

1. **Collect Data** (15 min):
   - Export user satisfaction survey responses
   - Compile "Pilot Feedback" task comments
   - Review automation rule effectiveness tracking
   - Review module creation log (time metrics)

2. **Categorize Feedback** (20 min):
   - **Wins**: What worked well (reinforce these)
   - **Pain Points**: What frustrated users (prioritize fixes)
   - **Improvements**: What users want changed (evaluate feasibility)
   - **Questions**: What confused users (improve training materials)

3. **Prioritize Issues** (15 min):
   - 🔴 P0 (BLOCKING): Prevents work, must fix immediately
   - 🟡 P1 (HIGH): Impacts quality or efficiency significantly
   - 🟢 P2 (LOW): Nice-to-have, low impact

4. **Create Action Plan** (10 min):
   - Assign owners for each P0/P1 issue
   - Set resolution deadlines (Week 2, Week 3, Post-Pilot)
   - Communicate action plan to pilot team (Slack #asana-pilot)

**Example Feedback Synthesis** (Week 1):
```
WINS:
- Rule 3 (Blocker Escalation) working perfectly - Nicole notified within 2 min
- Template duplication faster than manual setup (15 min vs 60 min)
- Custom fields (Module Code, Client Name) very useful for organization

PAIN POINTS:
- Rule 2 (Next Resource Notification) missing some handoffs (3 reports)
- Module Status field not auto-populating in portfolio view
- Training materials unclear on how to set custom fields

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add "Module Type" custom field (e.g., Standard, Film Shoot, Accelerated)
- Batch notifications for same assignee (reduce noise)
- Add FAQ section to user guide

ACTION PLAN:
- P0: Debug Rule 2 missed handoffs (Owner: Coordinator, Due: Nov 18)
- P1: Update training materials with custom field walkthrough (Owner: Coordinator, Due: Nov 20)
- P2: Evaluate "Module Type" custom field for post-pilot (Owner: Agent 1, Due: Dec 10)
```

## SECTION 5: TEMPLATE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (TRACK 1 PHASE 1 FOCUS)

### Track 1 Phase 1 Architecture Validation

**Context**: Track 1 Phase 1 (Portfolio Dashboard Architecture) designed 45-page comprehensive architecture with 8 query functions and custom field schema. Pilot validates this architecture is production-ready.

**Validation Scope**:
1. Custom field schema (programme-level and module-level fields)
2. Portfolio query functions (8 functions validated via TRACK_1_QUERY_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.py)
3. Health status calculation logic
4. Risk score calculation logic (based on blocker status, overdue tasks, dependencies)

---

### Custom Field Schema Validation

**Programme-Level Custom Fields** (Phase 4 - Not in Pilot Scope):
- Programme Number, Total Modules, Health Status, Programme Leader
- **Validation**: Phase 4 (Week 4-5), after pilot completion
- **Note**: Pilot focuses on module-level fields only

**Module-Level Custom Fields** (Phase 1A - Core 10):
| Field Name | Type | Validation Test | Expected Outcome | Pilot Week |
|------------|------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Module Code | Text | Create module with code "TEST101" | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Client Name | Text | Set to "Walbrook University" | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Programme Name | Text | Set to "MBA Marketing" | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Launch Date | Date | Set to "2025-11-15" | Field populated, relative dates work? | Week 1 |
| Go Live Date | Date | Set to "2025-12-20" (35 days after launch) | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Module Author (SME) | Person | Assign workspace user | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Learning Designer | Person | Assign workspace user | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Learning Technologist | Person | Assign workspace user | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Senior LD (Reviewer) | Person | Assign Nicole (workspace user) | Field populated correctly | Week 1 |
| Module Status | Single Select | Set to "Planning" initially | Enum selection works, Rule 1 updates correctly | Week 1-2 |

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ All 10 core fields created in Asana workspace (Agent 1 Phase 1A prerequisite)
- ✅ All 10 fields visible in pilot module projects
- ✅ Field values populate correctly via API or UI
- ✅ Field values accessible via Asana MCP API (for query functions)

---

### Portfolio Query Functions Validation

**Context**: Track 1 Phase 1 designed 8 query functions for portfolio dashboard:
1. `get_all_programmes()` - Retrieve all programmes with metadata
2. `get_modules_by_programme(programme_name)` - Filter modules by programme
3. `get_modules_by_status(status)` - Filter modules by Module Status field
4. `get_modules_by_client(client_name)` - Filter modules by Client Name field
5. `get_modules_launching_soon(days_threshold)` - Modules within X days of launch
6. `get_at_risk_modules()` - Modules with health status "At Risk" or "Blocked"
7. `calculate_programme_health(programme_name)` - Aggregate health across modules
8. `get_portfolio_summary()` - High-level dashboard metrics

**Pilot Validation Scope**: Functions 2-5 only (programme-level functions deferred to Phase 4)

**Validation Tests** (Week 2-3):

**Test 1: `get_modules_by_programme("MBA Marketing")`**
- **Setup**: Create 3-5 pilot modules with Programme Name = "MBA Marketing"
- **Expected**: Query returns all modules with Programme Name = "MBA Marketing"
- **Validation**: Run TRACK_1_QUERY_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.py Function 2 test
- **Success Criteria**: 100% of modules returned correctly

**Test 2: `get_modules_by_status("In Development")`**
- **Setup**: Use Rule 1 to update 2-3 modules to "In Development" status
- **Expected**: Query returns only modules with Module Status = "In Development"
- **Validation**: Run TRACK_1_QUERY_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.py Function 3 test
- **Success Criteria**: 100% of modules with correct status returned

**Test 3: `get_modules_by_client("Walbrook University")`**
- **Setup**: Create 2-3 pilot modules with Client Name = "Walbrook University"
- **Expected**: Query returns all modules with Client Name = "Walbrook University"
- **Validation**: Run TRACK_1_QUERY_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.py Function 4 test
- **Success Criteria**: 100% of modules returned correctly

**Test 4: `get_modules_launching_soon(30)`** (modules launching within 30 days)
- **Setup**: Set Go Live Date for 2 modules within 30 days, 2 modules >30 days
- **Expected**: Query returns only 2 modules launching within 30 days
- **Validation**: Run TRACK_1_QUERY_VALIDATION_EXAMPLES.py Function 5 test
- **Success Criteria**: Correct filtering based on Go Live Date

**Validation Timeline**:
- Week 2 Day 5 (Fri Nov 26): Run query validation tests
- Week 3 Day 2 (Tue Nov 30): Analyze query performance and accuracy
- Week 3 Day 3 (Wed Dec 3): Report query validation results in final feedback session

**Success Threshold**: 4/4 query tests pass with 100% accuracy

---

### Health Status Calculation Validation

**Context**: Track 1 Phase 1 defined health status calculation logic:
- **On Track**: No blockers, no overdue tasks, <5% tasks at risk
- **At Risk**: 1 blocker, 1-2 overdue tasks, 5-10% tasks at risk
- **Delayed**: 2 blockers, 3+ overdue tasks, 10-20% tasks at risk
- **Blocked**: 3+ blockers, 5+ overdue tasks, >20% tasks at risk

**Pilot Validation**: Test health status calculation on 2-3 pilot modules

**Validation Tests** (Week 2-3):

**Test 1: "On Track" Module**
- **Setup**: Module with no blockers, no overdue tasks, all tasks on schedule
- **Expected**: Health Status calculated as "On Track" (green)
- **Validation**: Manual calculation vs automated calculation match

**Test 2: "At Risk" Module**
- **Setup**: Module with 1 blocker (Waiting on SME), 1 overdue task
- **Expected**: Health Status calculated as "At Risk" (yellow)
- **Validation**: Manual calculation vs automated calculation match

**Test 3: "Blocked" Module**
- **Setup**: Module with 3 blockers (Technical Issue, Resource Gap, Waiting on Client), 5 overdue tasks
- **Expected**: Health Status calculated as "Blocked" (red)
- **Validation**: Manual calculation vs automated calculation match

**Validation Timeline**: Week 3 Day 2 (Tue Nov 30) - Health status validation analysis

**Success Threshold**: 3/3 health status calculations accurate (100% match)

---

### Automation Rules Integration with Track 1 Phase 1

**Integration Point 1: Rule 1 (Module Status Propagation) → Portfolio Dashboard**
- Module Status field updated automatically via Rule 1
- Portfolio query function `get_modules_by_status(status)` uses this field
- **Validation**: Verify query returns correct modules after Rule 1 triggers

**Integration Point 2: Rule 3 (Blocker Escalation) → Health Status Calculation**
- Blocker Status field triggers Rule 3 escalation
- Health status calculation includes blocker count
- **Validation**: Verify health status updates when blockers set/cleared

**Integration Point 3: Rule 5 (Launch Date Change) → `get_modules_launching_soon()`**
- Launch Date field changes trigger Rule 5 notification
- Query function filters modules by Go Live Date proximity
- **Validation**: Verify query returns correct modules after Launch Date change

**Pilot Focus**: Validate integration points work correctly (automation rules populate fields used by queries)

---

### Issue Escalation Protocol

**Priority Levels**:
- **🔴 P0 (CRITICAL)**: Blocking work, prevents pilot progress → Escalate immediately
- **🟡 P1 (HIGH)**: Impacts quality or efficiency significantly → Escalate within 24 hours
- **🟢 P2 (LOW)**: Nice-to-have improvement, low impact → Discuss at next weekly check-in

**Escalation Path**:
1. **User discovers issue** → Comment on "Pilot Feedback" task with priority flag
2. **Coordinator triages** → Assign priority level (P0/P1/P2)
3. **P0 issues** → Immediate Slack escalation @coordinator + @Andrew (if needed)
4. **P1 issues** → Coordinator investigates within 24 hours, resolves or escalates
5. **P2 issues** → Add to weekly check-in agenda for discussion

**P0 Examples**:
- Automation rule breaking critical workflow (e.g., Rule 4 not reopening tasks)
- Custom field data loss or corruption
- Template duplication failure (cannot create new modules)

**P1 Examples**:
- Automation rule false positives (>10 per day)
- Custom field not populating correctly (manual workaround possible)
- Training materials missing key information (confusion but not blocking)

**P2 Examples**:
- Notification wording unclear or verbose
- Custom field enum value needs additional option
- User guide could be improved with more examples

- **Timeline**: Start Phase 6 Week 1 (Dec 8-12, 2025)
- **Scope**: Roll out to next 10-15 modules over 4 weeks
- **Prerequisites**: None (pilot validated all critical functionality)

**Scenario 2: Pilot Successful with Improvements (7/8 Gates Pass)**
- **Decision**: CONDITIONAL - Address failing gate before broader rollout
- **Timeline**: 1-2 week improvement period → Start Phase 6 Week 3 (Dec 22-26)
- **Scope**: Limited rollout to next 5 modules while monitoring improvements
- **Prerequisites**: Fix failing gate, validate fix with 2-3 additional modules

**Scenario 3: Pilot Partially Successful (6/8 Gates Pass)**
- **Decision**: PAUSE - Major improvements needed before rollout
- **Timeline**: 3-4 week redesign period → Re-pilot with 3-5 modules → Reassess
- **Scope**: No broader rollout until re-pilot successful
- **Prerequisites**: Address all failing gates, comprehensive re-testing

**Scenario 4: Pilot Unsuccessful (<6/8 Gates Pass)**
- **Decision**: NO-GO - Return to design phase
- **Timeline**: 6-8 week redesign period → Fundamental changes needed
- **Scope**: No rollout, system requires significant rework
- **Prerequisites**: Architectural changes, potential technology shift

---

- Monitor for any new edge cases or issues
- Collect feedback via "Rollout Feedback" task template

**Week 4 (Dec 29 - Jan 2): Rollout Evaluation**
- Review rollout metrics (modules created, automation actions, issues)
- Conduct rollout retrospective (similar to pilot final session)
- Make Go/No-Go decision on Phase 7 (Full Adoption)
- Plan Phase 7 if successful (all new modules use template)

**Phase 6 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 20-25 modules created from template (pilot 10 + rollout 10-15)
- ✅ Automation action count <3,000/month (12% of 25,000 limit)
- ✅ <3 critical issues requiring template changes
- ✅ >80% of team confident using template independently

---

### Phase 7: Full Adoption (Week 5-8, Jan 5 - Feb 2, 2026)

   - Address any remaining training gaps or issues
   - Celebrate wins (time savings, quality improvements)

3. **Continuous Improvement** (Week 6-8):
   - Monthly review of automation rules (are they still effective?)
   - Quarterly review of custom fields (are new fields needed?)
   - Annual review of template structure (are sections still relevant?)

**Phase 7 Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 100% of new modules created from template (compliance)
- ✅ Average module creation time <10 minutes (efficiency target)
- ✅ Automation action count sustainable (<5,000/month for 30-50 modules)
- ✅ Team self-sufficient (no coordinator intervention needed)

### Appendix E: 5 Automation Rules - Quick Reference

**Rule 1: Module Status Propagation**
- **Trigger**: Milestone task completed (MPD, Week 8 Storyboard, Ready for Review, etc.)
- **Action**: Update "Module Status" custom field (Planning → In Development → Build → QA → Ready)
- **Benefit**: Real-time project visibility, no manual status updates

**Rule 2: Next Resource Notification**
- **Trigger**: Task completed
- **Action**: Notify assignee of dependent tasks now ready
- **Benefit**: Reduces coordination overhead, prevents bottlenecks

**Rule 3: Blocker Escalation**
- **Trigger**: "Blocker Status" field set (not "None")
- **Action**: Notify Senior LD immediately
- **Benefit**: Rapid intervention, prevents silent delays

**Rule 4: QA Approval Gate**
- **Trigger**: Task completion attempted with "QA Status = Changes Requested"
- **Action**: Auto-reopen task, notify assignee
- **Benefit**: Enforces quality gates, prevents premature completion

**Rule 5: Launch Date Change Notification**
- **Trigger**: "Launch Date" custom field modified
- **Action**: Notify team, create follow-up task for date recalculation
- **Benefit**: Timeline change awareness, coordinated response

**User Expectations**:
- Automation rules trigger within 1-5 minutes (not instant)
- Notifications sent via Asana inbox + email (based on user settings)
- Some false positives acceptable (manual override possible)
- Automation supplements workflow, doesn't replace human judgment

### Appendix F: Decision-Making Framework

**Pilot Evaluation Decision Tree** (Week 3 Day 3, Dec 3):

```
Pilot Evaluation Report Complete
│
├─ 8/8 Gates Pass?
│   ├─ YES → PROCEED to Phase 6 immediately (Dec 8)
│   └─ NO → Continue to next question
│
├─ 7/8 Gates Pass?
│   ├─ YES → CONDITIONAL
│   │   ├─ Which gate failed? (Critical or Non-Critical?)
│   │   ├─ Can fix be implemented in 1-2 weeks?
│   │   │   ├─ YES → Fix, validate, then Phase 6 (Dec 22)
│   │   │   └─ NO → PAUSE, 3-4 week improvement period
│   │   └─ Is failing gate blocking quality or safety?
│   │       ├─ YES → PAUSE, must fix before any rollout
│   │       └─ NO → Limited rollout (5 modules) while improving
│   └─ NO → Continue to next question
│
├─ 6/8 Gates Pass?
│   ├─ YES → PAUSE
│   │   ├─ Major improvements needed (3-4 weeks)
│   │   ├─ Re-pilot with 3-5 modules (2 weeks)
│   │   └─ Reassess based on re-pilot results
│   └─ NO → Continue to next question
│
└─ <6/8 Gates Pass?
    └─ NO-GO
        ├─ Return to design phase (6-8 weeks)
        ├─ Fundamental changes required
        └─ Potential technology or approach shift
```

**Critical Gates** (Must Pass for Any Rollout):
- Gate 1: Operational Deployment Success (infrastructure works)
- Gate 2: Automation Reliability (>95% trigger accuracy)
- Gate 8: Template Reusability (100% success rate)

**Important Gates** (Strong Preference):
- Gate 4: User Satisfaction (>80% approval)
- Gate 5: Efficiency Gains (<15 min module creation)
- Gate 6: Quality Assurance (QA gate effective)
- Gate 7: Blocker Escalation (<5 min escalation)

**Less Critical Gate**:
- Gate 3: Budget Compliance (<1,000 actions) - Can upgrade tier if needed
