# Next Steps After Tracks 1-3 Completion (October 23, 2025)

## Current Project State

**All Three Tracks COMPLETE** ✅
- Track 1 Phase 1: Portfolio Dashboard architecture implemented
- Track 2 Phase 1: All 10 critical task descriptions updated with Andrew compliance feedback
- Track 3: 100% Asana native implementation - 72/72 tasks with start_on field

**Git Status**: 
- Feature branch: feature/api-dependency-implementation
- 3 semantic commits pushed to remote
- Working tree: CLEAN
- Ready for pull request or continued development

## Strategic Decision Point: Template Conversion vs. Enhancement Expansion

**Current Architecture State**:
- ✅ Single module template (72 tasks, 12 sections, 52 dependencies)
- ✅ Native Asana implementation (no custom scripts or add-ons)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (technical manuals, guides, API reference)
- ⚠️ Template status uncertain (Project 1211626875246589 not found in workspace)

## Immediate Next Steps (Choose One Path)

### PATH A: Template Conversion & Validation (Recommended First)
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Purpose**: Establish template reproducibility before scaling

**Action Items**:
1. **Verify/Restore Template Status**
   - Determine if project was converted to template or deleted
   - If deleted: Recreate from current CSV + dependency mapping
   - If template exists: Test duplication workflow with new project
   - Document template creation process

2. **Test Template Duplication Workflow**
   - Create new project from template
   - Verify all 72 tasks + 52 dependencies replicate correctly
   - Test date anchoring (relative date calculations)
   - Validate custom field mappings

3. **Implement Date Calculation System**
   - Relative date anchoring to Launch Date
   - Holiday detection (Christmas, Academic out-of-office)
   - Automatic date propagation on Launch Date change
   - Test with multiple launch date scenarios

4. **Add Essential Custom Fields (5-7 fields)**
   - Module role assignment (LD, LT, SLD, PM)
   - Timeline tracking (start date, launch date, go live date)
   - Status indicators (phase, health)
   - Implement through API for reproducibility

5. **Document Template Duplication Process**
   - Step-by-step guide for creating new module projects from template
   - Configuration requirements and customization points
   - Validation checklist for module readiness

**Success Criteria**:
- Template proven reproducible with zero errors
- Duplication process documented and tested
- Date calculation system functioning correctly
- Custom fields enabling role assignment and tracking

---

### PATH B: Architecture Expansion (After Template Validation)
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks after Template validation
**Purpose**: Extend single-module template to multi-programme architecture

**Action Items**:
1. **Design Portfolio/Programme Hierarchy**
   - Portfolio container: [Client Name] Programmes
   - Programme level: [Programme Name] with multi-module tracking
   - Module projects: Use existing template as child projects
   - Implement programme-level custom fields and dependencies

2. **Implement Programme-Level Management**
   - View programmes with overall progress tracking
   - Cross-module dependency management
   - Resource allocation across modules
   - Budget and timeline aggregate reporting

3. **Add Role-Based Automation**
   - Automatic role assignment (LD, LT, SLD, PM) to tasks
   - Team capacity planning by role
   - Workload distribution across team
   - Escalation paths for overloaded team members

4. **Implement Advanced Custom Fields (15-20 fields)**
   - Module metadata (number, title, credits)
   - Budget tracking (allocation, actuals, variance)
   - Quality metrics (review status, completion %, rework required)
   - Client information (programme name, client name, contact)
   - Dependencies and risk tracking

5. **Create Reporting Dashboard**
   - Multi-programme overview (on-track/at-risk/off-track)
   - Module timeline Gantt view
   - Resource utilization dashboard
   - Budget vs. actuals tracking
   - Client visibility portal (read-only access)

**Success Criteria**:
- Multiple programmes tracked in single workspace
- Cross-module dependencies manageable
- Resource capacity visible and balanced
- Client reports automated and current

---

### PATH C: Workflow Integration (Parallel Track)
**Timeline**: 5-8 weeks (can run parallel with Paths A & B)
**Purpose**: Integrate additional 7 workflow areas with module development

**Current Coverage**: Workflow 4 only (Module Development)

**Missing Workflows to Integrate**:
1. **Workflow 1**: Business Development / Sales Pipeline
   - Lead qualification → Proposal → Contract → Handoff to delivery

2. **Workflow 2**: Client Onboarding / Initiation
   - Client kickoff → Requirements gathering → Stakeholder alignment → Project charter

3. **Workflow 3**: Programme Management (Global Oversight)
   - Portfolio planning → Risk management → Stakeholder reporting → Governance

4. **Workflow 5**: Team & Resource Management
   - Capacity planning → Skills assessment → Training needs → Team expansion

5. **Workflow 6**: Ongoing Client Management
   - Satisfaction monitoring → Change requests → Client escalations → Account reviews

6. **Workflow 7**: Finance & Operations
   - Budgeting → Time tracking → Invoice generation → Financial reporting

7. **Workflow 8**: Closeout & Follow-up
   - Module delivery → Knowledge transfer → Lessons learned → Follow-up projects

**Integration Approach**:
- Create workflow-specific templates (one per workflow)
- Establish integration points with module development workflow
- Implement cross-workflow dependencies
- Build unified portfolio view across all workflows

**Success Criteria**:
- All 8 workflows operational in single workspace
- Cross-workflow integration points functional
- End-to-end business process visible in Asana
- Reporting covers entire business lifecycle

## Recommended Execution Sequence

### Week 1-2: Template Validation (PATH A - CRITICAL PATH)
```
Priority: HIGHEST
Blocker: Other paths depend on this validation
Effort: 30-40 hours
Dependencies: Current template status verification
```

**Milestones**:
- Day 1-2: Verify template status (deleted vs. converted vs. ready)
- Day 3-4: Recreate or test existing template
- Day 5-7: Implement date calculation system
- Day 8-10: Add 5-7 essential custom fields
- Day 11-14: Document complete duplication process

---

### Week 3-4: Architecture Expansion (PATH B - CONDITIONAL)
```
Priority: HIGH (depends on Path A completion)
Blocker: Cannot expand architecture until template is validated
Effort: 35-45 hours
Dependencies: Path A validation complete
```

**Milestones**:
- Design programme hierarchy
- Implement portfolio structure
- Build programme-level reporting
- Create team assignment automation

---

### Week 5-8: Workflow Integration (PATH C - PARALLEL)
```
Priority: MEDIUM (can start partially while Path A/B in progress)
Blocker: Benefits from Path A/B context but independent workflows
Effort: 40-60 hours per workflow
Dependencies: None (can start immediately)
```

**Recommended Integration Order** (Suggested workflow sequences):
1. Workflow 2 (Onboarding) - Foundation for module work
2. Workflow 1 (Sales) - Prerequisite to onboarding
3. Workflow 3 (Programme Mgmt) - Encompasses Workflows 1-2 + 4
4. Workflow 5 (Resource Mgmt) - Essential for scaling
5. Workflow 7 (Finance) - Budget tracking across all workflows
6. Workflow 6 (Client Mgmt) - Continuous throughout
7. Workflow 8 (Closeout) - Terminal workflow after delivery

## Key Decision Points Requiring Andrew Input

**Before Path B (Architecture Expansion)**:
- Confirm portfolio/programme hierarchy design
- Define cross-module dependency requirements
- Approve custom field priorities (15-20 fields)
- Confirm reporting requirements

**Before Path C (Workflow Integration)**:
- Prioritize workflow implementation sequence
- Define workflow-specific requirements per workflow
