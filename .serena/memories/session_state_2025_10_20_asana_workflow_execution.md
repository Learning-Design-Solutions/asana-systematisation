# Session State: October 20, 2025 - Asana Systematisation Architecture Design

## Context
Executing comprehensive architecture review and design for full multi-program Asana structure based on:
1. Latest two transcripts (2025-10-14 and 2025-10-16)
2. Remote Google Doc: "Learning Design Solutions Workflows" (successfully accessed)
3. Current Asana test project implementation

## Key Documents Accessed

### Remote Google Doc Summary
**File**: "Learning Design Solutions Workflows"
**ID**: 1B2MqhK5EHbP9VNBwWpAeJWbUi__67Ki7IrkMsSV2Ldk
**Content**: 8 comprehensive workflows for Learning Design Solutions business

**Workflows Documented:**
1. **Business Development / Sales Pipeline** - Lead generation ‚Üí contract
2. **Client Onboarding / Initiation** - Contract ‚Üí kick-off
3. **Programme Management** - Global oversight of multiple modules
4. **Project / Module Development** - 16-week single module cycle (CURRENT SPEC COVERAGE)
5. **Team & Resource Management** - Subcontractor allocation and QA
6. **Ongoing Client Management** - Weekly reporting and issue escalation
7. **Finance & Operations** - Pricing, invoicing, Profit First allocations
8. **Closeout & Follow-up** - Project completion and relationship maintenance

### Critical Insight
**Current specification (v2.0) only covers Workflow 4** - single module development within a program.

**Missing scope:**
- Programme-level management (multiple modules per program)
- Module interconnection and tracking
- Business development pipeline
- Client onboarding processes
- Resource allocation across programs
- Financial tracking
- Closeout procedures

## Architecture Design Requirements

### Hierarchy Expansion Needed
**Current**: Portfolio ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Task/Subtask
**Required**: Portfolio ‚Üí Programme ‚Üí Project (Module) ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Task/Subtask

### Workflow Integration Required
- **Workflow 1**: Sales pipeline (CRM-like functionality in Asana)
- **Workflow 2**: Onboarding checklists and RACI templates
- **Workflow 3**: Programme dashboard with multiple module visibility
- **Workflow 4**: Current 16-week template (already specified)
- **Workflow 5**: Resource allocation tracker
- **Workflow 6**: Client communication log and issue tracker
- **Workflow 7**: Financial milestone tracking
- **Workflow 8**: Closeout checklist and follow-up reminders

### API Implementation Priorities
1. Native Asana task start dates
2. Relative date anchoring to Launch Date
3. Role assignment automation
4. Dependency chain configuration
5. Custom field population
6. Portfolio/Programme hierarchy creation
