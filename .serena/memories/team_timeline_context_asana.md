# Team & Timeline Context: Asana Systematisation

## Current Team
- Vlad (primary)
- Andrew (secondary)

## Planned Team Expansion
- Vlad to add: Alex
- Andrew to add: Nicole
- Timing: TBD but should happen after working system established

## Timeline
- **Primary Deadline**: End of November (fully complete systematisation)
- **Checkpoint Goal**: Completion/validation well before deadline
- **Validation Phase**: Before team expansion (need proven, documented system)

## Team Scaling Implications
- Documentation must be clear and accessible
- API patterns should be extractable to template
- Error handling and edge cases should be documented
- Knowledge transfer process needed before new team members join

## Project Phases
1. Enhancement (current)
2. Validation 
3. Team expansion readiness
4. Template conversion
5. Knowledge transfer to expanded team
