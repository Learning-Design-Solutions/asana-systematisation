## Session Outcomes
This session transformed a context-restored workflow from TODO-based task tracking to git-based implementation verification, successfully:
1. Analyzed all 17 uncommitted files
2. Verified implementation status for each file
3. Made targeted corrections to 2 files with outdated information
4. Organized commits by semantic grouping (deliverables, analysis, memory)
5. Left working tree clean and ready for next phase

**Recommendation**: Ready to proceed with either remote push, continued feature development, or new track implementation (Track 2 Phase 2 or additional workflow integration).
