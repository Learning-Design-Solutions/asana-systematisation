# DECISION POINT: Template Conversion vs. Pre-Conversion Enhancement

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: Awaiting decision
**Impact**: Affects implementation strategy for next phase

---

## The Decision

### Option A: Convert Template to Asana Template NOW
**Timing**: Immediately after capabilities analysis
**Process**:
1. Project Settings → "Convert to Template"
2. Name template: "LDS - Module Development Template v1"
3. Document usage instructions
4. Test duplication with sample project
5. Then enhance in live instances

**Pros**:
- ✅ Lock in current working state immediately
- ✅ Template available for use in other programmes
- ✅ Test template duplication before enhancement
- ✅ Can enhance on active instances (parallel work)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Would need to update template afterwards (harder process)
- ⚠️ Active instances won't get Phase 1 features automatically
- ⚠️ Requires more careful change management

---

### Option B: Implement Phase 1 BEFORE Template Conversion
**Timing**: 1-2 weeks of enhancement first
**Process**:
1. Activate Portfolio Dashboard on TEST project
2. Configure Status Reports
3. Test all Phase 1 features thoroughly
4. THEN convert to template
5. Template launches with Phase 1 features built-in

**Pros**:
- ✅ Template launches with multi-programme capability built-in
- ✅ Cleaner for future projects (no catching up)
- ✅ Validate Phase 1 benefits before rollout
- ✅ Fewer enhancement cycles needed

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Delays template availability by 1-2 weeks
- ⚠️ Requires parallel work on current modules
- ⚠️ More complex change management

## Recommendation

**Recommended**: **Option B (Enhance First, Then Convert)**

**Rationale**:
1. Portfolio Dashboard is the linchpin for multi-programme management
2. Implementing Phase 1 first validates the approach
3. Template should ship with this capability built-in
4. Only 1-2 week delay, but substantial long-term benefit

**Implementation Plan**:
- Week 1: Implement Phase 1 (Portfolio + Status Reports) on TEST project
- Week 1 validation: Get stakeholder feedback on portfolio view
- Week 2: Convert to template with Phase 1 features
- Week 2+: Rollout to other programmes

## Decision Ready For

- **User decision**: Which option aligns with business priorities?
- **Timeline**: How urgent is template availability?
- **Stakeholder input**: Any constraints or requirements?

**Expected response**: Proceed with Phase 1 enhancement, then template conversion
**Alternative**: If timeline critical, proceed with immediate conversion
