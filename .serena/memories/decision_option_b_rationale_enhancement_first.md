# Decision: Option B - Enhancement Before Template Conversion

## Decision
**Proceed with Option B**: Enhance the Asana systematisation project before converting to template format.

## Rationale
- Build out full capabilities and validations before formalizing as reusable template
- Gather real-world usage patterns and edge cases
- Ensure API interactions are robust and well-documented
- Team expansion (Vlad → Alex, Andrew → Nicole) benefits from working system
- Template conversion will be more valuable with proven implementation

## Timeline Implications
- Enhancement phase: Before Nov 30 deadline
- Validation: Before team expansion
- Template conversion: After systematisation validation complete
- Total project scope: Enhancement → Validation → Template → Knowledge transfer

## Key Decisions Made
1. Focus on feature completeness over template architecture
2. Prioritize API robustness and error handling
3. Document patterns as they emerge (enables better template)
4. Validate with real Asana workflows before formalizing
