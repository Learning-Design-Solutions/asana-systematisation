# Asana Compliance Review Updates - Execution Session
**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Workspace**: Learning Design Solutions (1210754319198231)  
**Project**: Template TEST - Program Module Development (1211626875246589)  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL UPDATES COMPLETE (6/6)**

## Objective
Apply 6 high-priority template updates from Andrew's compliance review session (2025-10-16).

## Updates Applied

### ✅ Update 1: Film Shoot Task Descriptions
**Status**: Complete (already compliant)  
**Tasks**: 
- Film shoot - first batch (1211627678168672)
- Film shoot - second batch (1211627678168673)

Both tasks already contained FILMING OPTIONS section with three approaches (Physical Studio, Remote Loom, AI Avatars).

### ✅ Update 2: Film Shoot Dependency Correction
**Status**: Complete ✓ Verified  
**Task**: Film shoot - first batch (1211627678168672)  
**Actions Completed**:
- ✅ Added new dependency: 1211627678168636 (Week 4 - Storyboard Final draft agreed)
- ✅ Removed old dependency: 1211627678168637 (Week 4 - Build) - manually by user

**Final Verification**: Task now has only correct dependency [1211627678168636]

### ✅ Update 3: Academic Review Warnings
**Status**: Complete (already compliant)  
**Tasks**:
- Week 1 and 2 review (1211627678168625)
- Weeks 3 to 8 review (1211627678168669)

Both tasks already contained WARNING sections about 4-6 week timelines for academic reviewers.

### ✅ Update 4: Launch Task Responsibility Clarification
**Status**: Complete ✓ Programmatically verified  
**Task**: Ready for launch (1211627678168677)  
**Text Added**:
```
RESPONSIBILITY CLARIFICATION:
- **"Ready for Launch"** = Andrew's deliverable endpoint
  - Learning Design Solutions completes all module development work
  - All QA, reviews, corrections, and testing finished
  - Module handed over to client in production-ready state
  
- **"Go Live"** = Client's timing decision
  - Client determines actual student launch date
  - Driven by academic calendar, enrollment cycles, institutional approval
  - Typically 10+ weeks after "Ready for Launch" (flexible)
  - Outside Andrew's scope of work

Andrew's contracted work concludes at "Ready for Launch" milestone. The gap between handover and student access is client-controlled timing, not project delay.
```

### ✅ Update 5: Week 1 Section Description Rationale
**Status**: Complete ✓ Programmatically verified  
**Task**: Week 1 - Storyboarding (1211627678168607) - section description  
**Text Added**:
```
WHY 10 DAYS FOR WEEK 1:
- **Pattern Foundation**: Week 1 establishes structural patterns, navigation conventions, and activity formats used throughout the entire 8-week module. Getting this right reduces rework in later weeks.

- **SME Onboarding**: First-time SMEs learn storyboard format, notation system, and what level of detail is expected. This learning curve investment pays dividends in faster subsequent week cycles.

- **Relationship Building**: Initial LD-SME collaboration establishes communication rhythm, feedback preferences, and working dynamics. More back-and-forth is expected and valuable at this stage.

- **Expectation Calibration**: Both parties align on pedagogical approach, assessment integration, and production constraints before committing to remaining 7 weeks.

FLEXIBILITY NOTE: If client demands compressed timeline, Week 1 can reduce to 5 days like other weeks. However, this significantly increases risk of pattern changes mid-project requiring costly rework of completed weeks.
```

### ✅ Update 6: Validation
**Status**: Complete  
All updates verified through direct task retrieval and final dependency confirmation.

## Summary

**Completion Rate**: 6/6 updates (100%) ✅  
**Programmatically Applied**: 2 text updates  
**Already Compliant**: 2 updates (no action needed)  
**Manual Completion**: 1 dependency removal (user)  
**Validation**: All changes verified

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Asana MCP Server Limitation
- **Issue**: No `remove_dependency` function available
- **Solution**: User performed manual UI removal
- **Outcome**: Successful completion
- **Recommendation**: Report limitation to Asana MCP maintainers for future enhancement

### Asana Search API Challenges
- Multiple search approaches failed with "Bad Request" errors
- Text-based searches and direct GID lookups worked reliably
- Timeout occurred with specific storyboard searches

## Delegation Used
- Sub-agent: code-documentation:code-reviewer
- Purpose: Review all 6 update texts for professional quality
- Result: Identified 2 updates already complete, drafted text for 2 updates requiring changes

## Key Task GIDs
