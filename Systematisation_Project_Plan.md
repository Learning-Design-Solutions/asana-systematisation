# Systematisation Project Plan

## 1. Workflow 1: Business Development / Sales Pipeline

### Objective:
To systematize the client acquisition process, moving from a referral-based model to a predictable pipeline, and to integrate pipeline management into Asana.

### Current State (Pain Points):
*   No CRM or systematization.
*   Leads can go cold due to slow HE decision-making.
*   Risk of losing opportunities by not following up systematically.
*   Pipeline management currently ad hoc and stressful.

### Aspirations for Asana:
*   System for capturing opportunities.
*   Tracking stages.
*   Follow-up reminders.

### Actionable Items:

#### 1.1. Lead Generation
*   **Strategy:** Leverage agencies (especially Instinct) to move from consultancy to end-to-end builds.
*   **Action:** Re-engage with Instinct (Gus Beecroft) to clarify next steps for representing LDS.
*   **Action:** Develop a clear message explaining LDS's value proposition to agencies.
*   **Action:** Maintain presence via LinkedIn engagement and occasional conferences.
*   **Action:** Proactive outreach on LinkedIn.

#### 1.2. Initial Contact
*   **Strategy:** Move conversation toward engaging with other institutional leaders (senior execs, deans, VCs, provosts).
*   **Action:** Develop a structured approach for initial calls to gather key information (online journey, existing provision, audience, ambitions, capacity, capability).

#### 1.3. Qualification
*   **Strategy:** Be more selective, focusing on opportunities with scalability potential (consultancy → pilot → full programme).
*   **Action:** Formalize decision factors for qualification (clear need for consultancy evolving into end-to-end build).

#### 1.4. Proposal / Tendering
*   **Strategy:** Always send a summary of understanding + potential offer. Push client to articulate: “This is what we want to do.” Stick to true cost + margin, avoid undercutting.
*   **Action:** Develop standardized proposal templates (currently bespoke).
*   **Action:** Implement a system for tracking proposals (currently emails and folders).

#### 1.5. Negotiation & Agreement
*   **Strategy:** Move from proposal to contract, including deliverables, timelines, schedules, financials.
*   **Action:** Formalize the process for locking scope, timeline, and budget.

#### 1.6. Handover to Onboarding
*   **Strategy:** Trigger handover with contract signing + introduction to operational team.
*   **Action:** Develop an onboarding questionnaire to capture key decisions, responsibilities, roles, effort levels, and contacts upfront.
*   **Action:** Create internal playbook for large projects (capturing key decisions, responsibilities, roles, effort levels, contacts).

#### 1.7. Tracking & Follow-up
*   **Strategy:** Implement a system for pipeline tracking to avoid gaps and manage leads effectively.
*   **Action:** Implement a CRM (Asana integration for pipeline management).
*   **Action:** Track warm/cold leads, delayed leads, lost opportunities.
*   **Action:** Set up reminders for follow-up.
*   **Action:** Gain visibility on future pipeline.

## 2. Workflow 2: Client Onboarding / Initiation

### Objective:
To formalize and systematize the client onboarding process, ensuring consistency and scalability.

### Current State (Pain Points):
*   Much of onboarding is currently in Andrew’s head rather than formalized.
*   Lack of systematic steps, procedures, or templates.
*   Initial onboarding at institutional level doesn’t always cascade effectively to module/project level onboarding.
*   Risks: gaps in clarity, delays when roles or responsibilities aren’t clearly defined.

### Actionable Items:

#### 2.1. Trigger Point
*   **Strategy:** The true “onboarding moment” is usually the kick-off call with the operational team, rather than just the signed contract.
*   **Action:** Define clear criteria for the "onboarding moment" and associated triggers.

#### 2.2. Kick-off Process
*   **Strategy:** Proactively engage with key people who will influence the project.

*   **Strategy:** Develop metrics-based resource planning.
*   **Action:** Create resource planning templates to estimate effort based on content type and media requirements.

#### 2.7. Alignment with Client Team
*   **Strategy:** Conduct early teaching and learning strategy meetings with key stakeholders.
*   **Action:** Develop a collaborative onboarding process for SMEs, module by module.
*   **Action:** Implement training and support for SMEs.

## 3. Workflow 3: Programme Management (Global Oversight – Final Draft)
