## 10. Conclusion

The current Asana template is a **strong foundation** for Module Development (Workflow 4) but leaves significant opportunities unexploited for the broader systematisation objective.

**Key Finding**: Implementing **Portfolio + Status Reports + Approvals** (16 hours total effort) would increase template systematisation value by approximately **50-60%**, enabling:
- Multi-programme visibility (critical gap)
- Quality management systematisation
- Financial tracking foundation
- Stakeholder reporting capability

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 immediately (next 1-2 weeks), which would demonstrate portfolio-level functionality and establish proof-of-concept for expanded Asana systematisation.
