# Learning Design Solutions - Project Tracker

This document tracks the progress of the operational excellence and systematisation project for Learning Design Solutions.

## Phase 1: Operational Excellence & Systematisation

### Project 3: Project & Task Management Systematisation (Asana Implementation)

*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Objective:** To transition LDS from spreadsheets to a dedicated project and task management software (Asana) and establish collaborative workflows.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   A fully configured Asana workspace for LDS.
    *   Standardised project initiation and delivery templates within Asana.
    *   Documented workflows for client, internal, and contractor collaboration within Asana.
    *   Training for Andrew and Debbie on using the new system effectively.

### Asana Workflow Projects

We will be creating a series of Asana projects to house the defined workflows. For each workflow, a dedicated instruction file will be created in this repository. You will then create the project in Asana and provide the link.

**Workflow Projects:**

1.  **Business Development / Sales Pipeline**
    *   **Instructions:** [Asana_Sales_Pipeline_Project.md](Asana_Sales_Pipeline_Project.md)
