# Phase 1 Implementation Plan: Operational Excellence & Systematisation
________________

## üí° Overview
This action plan focuses exclusively on immediate and short-term initiatives that deliver fast, visible impact. These steps are independent of the long-term strategy and are designed to:
* Systematise and codify LDS operational workflows
* Implement foundational systems for efficient project delivery
* Optimise financial management for sustainable growth
* Prepare the basic systems that will be used as part of the complete strategy
* Capture critical information used to refine the business strategy

## üîç Operational Excellence & Systematisation
### Priority 1: Time-Tracking and Financial Management
*   **Objective:** Implement a comprehensive time-tracking solution to manage projects, milestones, and tasks, and integrate this into the operational and financial framework.
*   **Actionables:**
    *   Implement a time-tracking software and establish workflows for its use.
    *   Match both expenses and time (internal staff and external contractors) against projects, milestones, and tasks.
    *   Track costs against the budgets allocated to projects, milestones, and tasks.
    *   Adopt the "Profit First" methodology for sustainable financial management.
    *   Transition towards deliverable-based invoicing, tracking costs per module and project.

### Priority 2: SOP Development and Workflow Analysis
*   **Objective:** Implement an operational framework for analyzing, systematising, and codifying internal work processes.
*   **Actionables:**
    *   Implement Loom for daily activity recording to identify and capture core workflows.
    *   Utilise ScribeHow to create detailed, step-by-step Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for key roles.
    *   Analyze recordings and SOPs to identify patterns that direct decisions around which operational workflows are worth automating.
    *   Codify the decisions and rules for automation, and establish a system for improving on those decisions and rules.

### Priority 3: Project & Task Management Systematisation
*   **Objective:** Transition from spreadsheets to a dedicated project and task management software, and establish collaborative workflows.
*   **Actionables:**
    *   Transition from Excel to Asana for centralised project and task tracking.
    *   Develop standardised project initiation and delivery templates within Asana.
    *   Establish workflows for including and collaborating with clients, internal staff, and contracted workforce within Asana.

### Priority 4: AI-Assisted Project Management & Automation
*   **Objective:** Analyze and implement an automated, AI-assisted project and task management system to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
*   **Actionables:**
    *   Analyze workflows related to project management, including project scoping, task creation, deliverable validation, stakeholder communication, and quality assurance.
    *   Implement an automated project and task management system enhanced by AI-assisted decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Tools Needed
*   **Core Tools:** Loom, ScribeHow, Asana, Google Workspace (Drive, Sheets).
*   **Future Consideration:** Explore advanced AI (e.g., Gemini) for processing large-form inputs and further systematising operations.

## ‚úÖ Summary
These Phase 1 initiatives are:
* High impact
* Low complexity
* Time-sensitive

They are meant to create momentum and validate key assumptions before deeper strategy execution begins. Everything here can be launched before Q4 2025.
