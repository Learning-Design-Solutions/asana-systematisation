## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed analysis of the actual module development template currently used by Learning Design Solutions. The template reveals a **17-18 week development cycle** (not 16 weeks as initially assumed), with specific task structures, resource assignments, and review patterns that must be precisely replicated in Asana.

### Key Findings

1. **Actual Duration**: 17-18 weeks from kickoff to launch (September 15, 2025 → March 11, 2026)
2. **Week 1 Special Treatment**: Week 1 gets 10 days for storyboarding (vs 5 days for weeks 2-8)
3. **Batched Reviews**: Academic reviews happen in two batches (Weeks 1-2, then Weeks 3-8)
4. **Parallel Workflows**: Storyboarding and building happen concurrently once process is underway
5. **Film Shoots**: Two dedicated film shoot phases (after Week 4 and after Week 8)
6. **Resource Split**: Clear distinction between LDS resources and client resources

## Template Structure Breakdown

### Column Headers (Template Metadata)

| Column | Purpose | Data Type | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Task Name** | Task/subtask description | Text | Indentation indicates hierarchy |
| **Duration** | How long task takes | Text (e.g., "5 days") | Business days only |
| **Start - Monday** | Task start date | Date (MM/DD/YYYY) | Always Monday |
| **Finish - Friday** | Task end date | Date (MM/DD/YYYY) | Always Friday |
| **Resource LDS** | LDS team member | Text | Learning Designer, Learning Technologist |
| **Resource Walbrook** | Client team member | Text | SME, Academic Reviewer, etc. |
| **% Complete** | Progress tracking | Percentage | Manually updated |
| **Weeks 1-18** | Gantt timeline columns | Visual | For Gantt-style visualization |

---

## Phase 1: Initiation & Planning (Weeks 0-2)

### Phase Overview
- **Duration**: 3 weeks (September 15 - October 3, 2025)
- **Purpose**: Align with SME, establish module structure, create foundational documents
- **Key Deliverables**: MPD finalized, assessment briefs approved, reading list confirmed

### Tasks Breakdown

#### 1.1 Kickoff Meeting (Week 0 - First Week)
**Duration**: 5 days (09/15 - 09/19)

| Task | Duration | LDS Resource | Client Resource | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Kick off meeting** | 5 days | - | - | Parent task grouping |
| ↳ Initiation meeting held | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME | Module scope discussion |
| ↳ Kick off meeting held | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME | Formal kickoff with client |

**Notes**:
- These appear to be two related tasks, possibly:
  - "Initiation meeting" = internal LDS prep meeting
  - "Kick off meeting" = formal client-facing kickoff
- Both involve LD and SME
- Set foundation for all subsequent work

#### 1.2 Module Planning Document (MPD) Development (Weeks 1-2)
**Duration**: 10 days (09/22 - 10/03)

| Task | Duration | LDS Resource | Client Resource | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Module Planning Document** | 10 days | - | - | Parent task |
| ↳ MPD Draft | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME | Initial module structure |
| ↳ MPD Finalised | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME | Incorporate SME feedback |
| ↳ Assessment briefs drafted | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME, Programme Leader | Design assessments |
| ↳ Reading list revised | 5 days | Learning Designer | SME, Librarian | Curate resources |
| MPD review | 5 days | - | Academic Reviewer | Client-side formal review |

**Notes**:
- MPD Draft and MPD Finalised are sequential (Draft Week 1, Finalize Week 2)
- Assessment briefs and Reading list happen in parallel with MPD Finalize (Week 2)
- Academic review of MPD happens in Week 3 (overlapping with start of Week 1 content)

**Key Insight**: The template shows that initiation tasks can overlap with the start of content development (Week 1 storyboarding begins before MPD review completes).

---

## Phase 2: Content Development - Weeks 1-8 (Weeks 3-14)

### Phase Overview
- **Duration**: Approx. 12 weeks (October 6 - December 13, 2025)
- **Purpose**: Create, review, and build all 8 weeks of student-facing module content
- **Pattern**: Storyboard → Edit → Approve → Build (with variations)

### Week 1 Special Case (Extended Timeline)

**Duration**: 10 days for storyboarding + 5 days for building = 15 days total

| Task | Duration | Start | End | LDS Resource | Client Resource |
|------|----------|-------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Week 1** | 10 days | 10/06 | 10/17 | - | - |
| ↳ Storyboard Initial LD Draft | 5 days | 10/06 | 10/10 | Learning Designer | - |
| ↳ Storyboard SME Scripts Draft | 5 days | 10/06 | 10/10 | - | SME |
| ↳ Edit | 3 days | 10/13 | 10/15 | Learning Designer | SME |
| ↳ Storyboard Final draft agreed | 2 days | 10/16 | 10/17 | Learning Designer | SME |
| **Week 1 - Build** | 5 days | 10/20 | 10/25 | Learning Technologist | - |

**Key Observations**:
- **More Time**: Week 1 gets 10 days vs 5 days for other weeks (likely because it sets the template for subsequent weeks)
- **Parallel Initial Drafts**: LD and SME work simultaneously on their portions
- **Sequential Refinement**: Edit and Final draft are sequential after initial drafts
- **Build Delay**: Build starts 3 days after storyboard is approved (not immediate)

### Week 1-2 Academic Review (Batched)

**Duration**: 5 days (11/03 - 11/08)

| Task | Duration | Start | End | LDS Resource | Client Resource |
|------|----------|-------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Week 1 and 2 review** | 5 days | 11/03 | 11/08 | - | Academic Reviewer |

**Key Insight**: First two weeks are reviewed together as a batch, providing early quality feedback before remaining weeks are completed.

### Weeks 2-8 Standard Pattern (Compressed Timeline)

**Duration per week**: 5 days for storyboarding + 5 days for building = 10 days total (overlapping)

**Standard Pattern (Example: Week 2)**:

| Task | Duration | Start | End | LDS Resource | Client Resource |
|------|----------|-------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Week [X]** | 5 days | varies | varies | - | - |
| ↳ Storyboard Initial LD Draft | 2 days | Day 1-2 | - | Learning Designer | - |
| ↳ Storyboard SME Scripts Draft | 2 days | Day 1-2 | - | - | SME |
| ↳ Edit | 2 days | Day 3-4 | - | Learning Designer | SME |
| ↳ Storyboard Final draft agreed | 1 day | Day 5 | - | Learning Designer | SME |
| **Week [X] - Build** | 5 days | +7 days | - | Learning Technologist | - |

**Pattern Observed**:
- Initial drafts: 2 days (parallel)
- Edit: 2 days (collaborative)
- Final approval: 1 day (sign-off)
- Build: 5 days (starts about a week after storyboard completion)

### Film Shoots (Integrated into Timeline)

#### Film Shoot - First Batch
**Duration**: 6 days (11/10 - 11/15)
**Timing**: Inserted after Week 4 storyboarding, during Week 4-5 build phase
**Resources**: Digital Learning Team (client-side)

#### Film Shoot - Second Batch
**Duration**: 5 days (12/08 - 12/12)
**Timing**: After Week 8 content complete, during finalization phase
**Resources**: Digital Learning Team (client-side)

**Key Insight**: Film shoots are scheduled strategically:
- First batch: Mid-project (allows time for early content filming)
- Second batch: End of content phase (captures remaining materials)

### Weeks 3-8 Academic Review (Batched)

**Duration**: 5 days (12/22 - 12/26)
**Timing**: After all 8 weeks built, before final corrections
**Resources**: Academic Reviewer (client-side)

**Key Insight**: Second batch review happens over the Christmas period (potential scheduling risk).

---

## Phase 3: Finalization & Launch Prep (Weeks 15-18)

### Phase Overview
- **Duration**: Approximately 3-4 weeks (December 8, 2025 - January 5, 2026)
- **Purpose**: Polish, proofread, correct, and prepare for launch
- **Overlaps**: Finalization starts before all content builds are complete

### Finalization Tasks

| Task | Duration | Start | End | LDS Resource | Client Resource |
|------|----------|-------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Finalisation** | 20 days | 12/08 | 01/02 | - | - |
| ↳ Film shoot - second batch | 5 days | 12/08 | 12/12 | - | Digital Learning Team |
| ↳ Proofreading | 5 days | 12/15 | 12/19 | - | Editorial Team |
| ↳ Weeks 3 to 8 review | 5 days | 12/22 | 12/26 | - | Academic Reviewer |
| ↳ Corrections | 5 days | 12/29 | 01/02 | LD/LT | SME |

**Key Observations**:
- **Overlapping Work**: Finalization tasks begin while Week 8 build is still in progress
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Proofreading → Review → Corrections (mostly sequential)
- **Shared Responsibility**: Corrections handled by either LD or LT, with SME support
- **Holiday Timing**: Review scheduled over Christmas week (potential client availability issue)

### Launch Readiness

| Task | Duration | Date | LDS Resource | Client Resource |
|------|----------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Ready for launch** | 1 day | 01/05/2026 | - | - |
| **Go live** | - | Mon 03/11/25 | - | - |

**Discrepancy Found**: "Go live" date shows "03/11/25" which appears to be a typo (should be 03/11/26 based on timeline).

**Gap Identified**: There's a 2-month gap between "Ready for launch" (January 5) and "Go live" (March 11). This suggests:
- Buffer period for final client preparations
- OR Template dates need adjustment for actual usage

---

## Resource Assignment Patterns

### LDS Resources (Internal Team)

| Role | Abbreviation | Tasks Assigned | Typical Duration |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Learning Designer** | LD | Storyboard drafting, editing, MPD creation, assessment briefs, reading list | Throughout project |
| **Learning Technologist** | LT | Building all 8 weeks of content, corrections | Weeks 4-17 |
| **Learning Designer/Technologist** | LD/LT | Final corrections (flexible assignment) | Week 17 |

**Key Observations**:
- LD is involved from start to finish (Weeks 0-17)
- LT joins later (from Week 4 onwards) for build phase
- Corrections can be handled by either LD or LT depending on nature of work

### Client Resources (Walbrook/External)

| Role | Tasks Assigned | Typical Duration | Notes |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **SME (Module Author)** | All content review, script drafting, MPD collaboration, editing | Throughout project | Most critical client resource |
| **Programme Leader** | Assessment brief approval | Week 2 | Limited engagement |
| **Librarian** | Reading list validation | Week 2 | Limited engagement |
| **Academic Reviewer** | MPD review, Week 1-2 review, Weeks 3-8 review | Weeks 3, 7, 17 | Batched quality assurance |
| **Digital Learning Team** | Film shoots (2 batches) | Weeks 9 & 15 | Video production support |
| **Editorial Team** | Proofreading | Week 16 | Final polish |

**Key Observations**:
- **SME is constant** throughout the project (highest dependency risk)
- **Batched Reviews**: Academic reviews happen in two chunks (early and late)
- **Specialized Roles**: Client provides specialized support (video, editorial, library)

## Dependency Chain Analysis

### Critical Path Sequence

```
Kickoff Meeting (Week 0)
    ↓
MPD Draft (Week 1)
    ↓
MPD Finalized (Week 2) → Assessment Briefs (Week 2)
    ↓                      ↓
MPD Review (Week 3)    Reading List (Week 2)
    ↓
Week 1 Storyboard (Weeks 3-4)
    ↓
Week 1 Build (Week 5)
    ↓
Week 1-2 Review (Week 7) ← Week 2 Build (Week 6)
    ↓
Weeks 2-8 Storyboard & Build (Weeks 4-14) [overlapping]
    ↓
All Content Complete (Week 14)
    ↓
Proofreading (Week 16)
    ↓
Weeks 3-8 Review (Week 17)
    ↓
Corrections (Week 17)
    ↓
Ready for Launch (Week 18)
    ↓
[2-month buffer]
    ↓
Go Live (Week 26)
```

### Parallel Work Streams

**Weeks 1-2 (Initiation Phase)**:
- MPD Draft (sequential)
- MPD Finalized + Assessment Briefs + Reading List (parallel)

**Weeks 3-14 (Content Development)**:
- Week N: Storyboarding (5-10 days)
- Week N+1: Building Week N (5 days) + Storyboarding Week N+1 (5 days) [parallel]
- Continuous overlap once pipeline is established

**Weeks 15-17 (Finalization)**:
- Film Shoot 2 → Proofreading → Review → Corrections (mostly sequential)
- Week 8 Build overlaps with early finalization tasks

### Dependency Rules

1. **Sequential Dependencies**:
   - MPD must be drafted before it can be finalized
   - Storyboard must be approved before build begins
   - Build must complete before review can happen
   - Review must happen before corrections can be made

2. **Soft Dependencies** (Recommended but not blocking):
   - Week 1 should be reviewed before Week 3-8 are all completed (quality feedback loop)
   - Film shoots should align with content readiness (can't film before scripts exist)

3. **Batching Logic**:
   - Weeks 1-2: Reviewed together (early quality check)
   - Weeks 3-8: Reviewed together (efficiency gain)
   - Rationale: Reduces client reviewer burden, provides consistent feedback

## Timeline Calculations & Relative Dates

### Actual Timeline from Template

| Milestone | Date | Week Number | Days from Start |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Kickoff** | 09/15/2025 | Week 0 | 0 |
| MPD Draft Start | 09/22/2025 | Week 1 | 7 |
| MPD Review Start | 10/06/2025 | Week 3 | 21 |
| Week 1 Storyboard Start | 10/06/2025 | Week 3 | 21 |
| Week 1 Build Start | 10/20/2025 | Week 5 | 35 |
| Week 1-2 Review | 11/03/2025 | Week 7 | 49 |
| Film Shoot 1 | 11/10/2025 | Week 9 | 56 |
| Week 8 Build End | 12/13/2025 | Week 13 | 89 |
| Proofreading | 12/15/2025 | Week 13 | 91 |
| Week 3-8 Review | 12/22/2025 | Week 14 | 98 |
| Corrections End | 01/02/2026 | Week 16 | 109 |
| **Ready for Launch** | 01/05/2026 | Week 16 | 112 |
| **Go Live** | 03/11/2026 | Week 26 | ~178 |

### Duration Analysis

- **Initiation to Week 1 Build**: 5 weeks (35 days)
- **Initiation to All Content Complete**: 13 weeks (89 days)
- **Initiation to Ready for Launch**: 16 weeks (112 days)
- **Initiation to Go Live**: 26 weeks (178 days) - includes 10-week buffer

### Relative Date Formula for Asana

**Anchor Point**: Module Launch Date (Go Live)

**Working Backwards from Launch**:

| Task/Milestone | Days Before Launch |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Go Live | 0 (anchor) |
| Ready for Launch | -66 days (~10 weeks) |
| Corrections End | -69 days |
| Week 3-8 Review Start | -80 days |
| Proofreading Start | -87 days |
| Week 8 Build End | -89 days |
| Film Shoot 1 | -122 days |
| Week 1 Storyboard Start | -157 days |
| MPD Draft Start | -171 days |
| Kickoff Meeting | -178 days |

**Key Insight**: The template assumes a **10-week buffer** between "Ready for Launch" and actual launch. This may be intentional (client testing period) or template-specific.

**Recommendation for Asana**:
- Create two versions of relative dates:
  - **Version A**: 16-week development cycle (Kickoff → Ready for Launch)
  - **Version B**: 26-week full cycle (Kickoff → Go Live) if buffer is standard

---

## Task Hierarchies & Subtasks

### Hierarchical Structure in Template

**Example: Week 2 Content Development**

```
Week 2 (Parent Task)
├── Week 2 - Storyboard Initial LD Draft (Subtask)
├── Week 2 - Storyboard SME Scripts Draft (Subtask)
├── Week 2 - Edit (Subtask)
└── Week 2 - Storyboard Final draft agreed (Subtask)

Week 2 - Build (Separate Top-Level Task, not subtask)
```

**Key Observation**: In the spreadsheet, "Build" tasks are NOT subtasks of the "Week X" parent. They are separate top-level tasks. This suggests:
- Storyboarding and Building are treated as distinct phases
- Allows for easier filtering (show only storyboarding tasks, or only build tasks)
- Aligns with the fact that LD handles storyboarding, LT handles building (different resource pools)

### Recommended Asana Hierarchy

**Option 1: Sections for Each Week**
```
SECTION: Week 1 Content Development
- Task: Week 1 - Storyboard Initial LD Draft
- Task: Week 1 - Storyboard SME Scripts Draft
- Task: Week 1 - Edit
- Task: Week 1 - Storyboard Final Draft Agreed [Milestone]
- Task: Week 1 - Build [Milestone]
```

**Option 2: Subtasks for Granularity**
```
SECTION: Week 1 Content Development
- Task: Week 1 - Storyboarding [Milestone]
  - Subtask: Initial LD Draft
  - Subtask: SME Scripts Draft
  - Subtask: Collaborative Edit
  - Subtask: Final Draft Approval
- Task: Week 1 - Build [Milestone]
  - Subtask: VLE Page Setup
  - Subtask: Media Upload & Embedding
  - Subtask: Interactive Element Configuration
  - Subtask: Testing & QA
```

**Recommendation**: Use **Option 1** to mirror the spreadsheet structure (simpler, matches current workflow). Option 2 adds more granularity but may be overkill initially.

## Custom Field Requirements (Revised)

Based on the actual template, here are the custom fields needed:

### Core Identification Fields

| Field Name | Type | Options | Source Column | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Module Code** | Text | - | External | Unique identifier (e.g., "MBA-SF") |
| **Module Title** | Text | - | Row 3 (Header) | Full module name |

### Date Fields

| Field Name | Type | Auto-Calculate | Source Column | Purpose |
|------------|------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Start Date** | Date | From Launch Date | "Start - Monday" | Task start (always Monday) |
| **End Date** | Date | From Launch Date | "Finish - Friday" | Task end (always Friday) |
| **Launch Date** | Date | User Input (Anchor) | "Go live" | Module go-live date |
| **Ready Date** | Date | Auto (Launch - 66 days) | "Ready for launch" | Development complete date |

### Resource Fields

| Field Name | Type | Options | Source Column | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **LDS Resource** | Dropdown | Learning Designer, Learning Technologist, LD/LT, SLD | "Resource LDS" | Who from LDS team |
| **Client Resource** | Dropdown | SME, Programme Leader, Academic Reviewer, Librarian, Digital Learning Team, Editorial Team | "Resource Walbrook" | Who from client team |

**Note**: These could also be **Person** fields if assigning specific team members, but Dropdown is more flexible for template usage.

### Progress Tracking Fields

| Field Name | Type | Options | Source Column | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **% Complete** | Number (0-100) | - | "% Complete" | Manual progress tracking |
| **Status** | Dropdown | Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete, Blocked | Derived | Overall task status |
| **Phase** | Dropdown | Initiation, Week 1-8 Content, Finalization | Derived | Project phase |

### Duration Field

| Field Name | Type | Options | Source Column | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Duration (Days)** | Number | - | "Duration" | Task length in business days |

**Note**: Asana has built-in duration based on start/end dates, but explicitly tracking it can help with calculations.

---

## Gaps & Discrepancies Found

### 1. Timeline Discrepancy
- **Issue**: "Go live" date shows "Mon 03/11/25" but should be 03/11/26 based on timeline
- **Impact**: Template may have typo, or dates need manual adjustment for each instance
- **Recommendation**: Clarify with Andrew if this is intentional buffer or error

### 2. Missing SLD (Senior LD) Role
- **Issue**: Template doesn't explicitly show SLD reviews, but Workflow 4 documentation mentions Nicole (SLD) doing QA
- **Impact**: QA tasks may be implicit or handled outside the template
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit SLD QA tasks in Asana template

### 3. No Explicit Dependencies
- **Issue**: Spreadsheet doesn't have formal dependency tracking (just logical sequencing by dates)
- **Impact**: Dependencies are implied but not enforced
- **Recommendation**: Asana template should add explicit dependencies to prevent tasks starting prematurely

### 4. Christmas Holiday Period
- **Issue**: "Weeks 3-8 review" scheduled 12/22-12/26 (Christmas week)
- **Impact**: Academic reviewer may not be available
- **Recommendation**: Flag this as a scheduling risk, potentially add buffer or alternate timing

### 5. 10-Week Post-Launch Buffer
- **Issue**: 10 weeks between "Ready for launch" and "Go live" is unusually long
- **Potential Reasons**:
  - Client needs time for internal testing
  - University semester scheduling (modules launch on specific dates)
  - Template includes buffer for flexibility
- **Recommendation**: Clarify with Andrew what this gap represents

---

## Key Takeaways for Asana Implementation

### 1. Duration is 17-18 Weeks, Not 16
- Initial planning was based on 16-week cycle
- Actual development from kickoff to "Ready for Launch": **16 weeks**
- Full cycle including buffer: **26 weeks** (if buffer is standard)
- **Action**: Update all documentation and Asana template accordingly

### 2. Week 1 Gets Special Treatment
- Week 1: 10 days for storyboarding (vs 5 for others)
- Rationale: Sets template and quality bar for remaining weeks
- **Action**: Configure Week 1 section with longer durations

### 3. Batched Reviews Are Critical
- Academic reviews happen in two batches (Weeks 1-2, then Weeks 3-8)
- This reduces client burden and provides early/late quality feedback
- **Action**: Create batched review tasks, not per-week reviews

### 4. Build Tasks Are Separate, Not Subtasks
- In spreadsheet, "Build" is a top-level task, not subtask of "Week X"
- **Action**: Mirror this structure in Asana for consistency

### 5. Film Shoots Are Integrated
- Two film shoot phases are part of the development timeline
- Must be scheduled with client Digital Learning Team
- **Action**: Include film shoot tasks in template with appropriate timing

### 6. Clear Resource Distinction
- Template clearly separates LDS resources vs client resources
- This is critical for understanding who owns what
- **Action**: Use custom fields to track both resource types

### 7. Overlapping Work Streams
- Once Week 2 starts, storyboarding and building happen concurrently
- This is the "pipeline" that allows efficient throughput
- **Action**: Configure dependencies to allow appropriate parallelism

---

## Next Steps for Asana Template Creation

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Specification Document**
   - Revise from 16-week to 17-18-week model
   - Incorporate actual task structure from spreadsheet
   - Add batched review tasks
   - Include film shoot phases

2. **Validate Timeline with Andrew**
   - Confirm 10-week post-launch buffer purpose
   - Verify Christmas week scheduling approach
   - Check if Week 1 extended timeline is standard

3. **Build Asana Template**
   - Create sections matching actual phases
   - Add all tasks from spreadsheet
   - Configure custom fields
   - Set up dependencies

4. **Test with Sample Module**
   - Duplicate template
   - Set launch date
   - Verify relative dates calculate correctly
   - Check dependency chains work

### Questions for Andrew

1. **Launch Buffer**: Is the 10-week gap between "Ready" and "Go Live" standard, or template-specific?
2. **Week 1 Duration**: Should all projects give Week 1 longer storyboard time, or only initially?
3. **SLD Reviews**: Where should Nicole's (SLD) QA reviews be explicitly tracked?
4. **Holiday Scheduling**: How do you typically handle reviews falling on holidays?
5. **Film Shoots**: Are film shoots standard for all modules, or only media-heavy ones?
