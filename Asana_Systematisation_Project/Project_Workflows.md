# Workflow 1: Business Development / Sales Pipeline (Structured Draft) {#workflow-1:-business-development-/-sales-pipeline-(structured-draft)}

**1\. Lead Generation**

* **Main sources:**  
  1. **Agencies** (esp. Instinct) → historically most impactful.  
     * Early consultancy contracts (e.g. ICAS) evolved into large-scale development projects.  
     * Strategy: leverage agencies to move from consultancy → end-to-end builds.  
  2. **Network / Referrals**  
     * Strong industry network from years in HE.  
     * Projects from past colleagues (AUB, Walbrook, Warwick).  
     * Maintaining presence via LinkedIn engagement, occasional conferences.  
  3. **Proactive Outreach**  
     * Mostly LinkedIn interactions, sometimes conferences.  
     * Website enquiries: none so far.  
* **Tracking:** No CRM. Leads/opportunities tracked mentally or via email.  
* **Agency relationship:** Agencies act as introducers, benefit financially from pushing work to LDS.

---

**2\. Initial Contact**

* **Channels:**  
  * Agencies: email \+ call.  
  * Network: email or LinkedIn message.  
  * Outreach: LinkedIn, sometimes conferences.  
* **Style:**  
  * Initial calls are free-ranging conversations.  
  * Clients share context, provision, ambitions, concerns.  
  * Andrew positions himself as the person who both knows what’s possible and highlights “unknown unknowns” the client hasn’t yet considered.  
* **Key early step:**  
  * Move conversation toward engaging with other institutional leaders (senior execs, deans, VCs, provosts).  
* **Information sought:**  
  * Where are you in your online journey?  
  * Existing provision (in-house or not)?  
  * Audience and ambitions?  
  * Capacity and capability?  
  * Why online?

---

**3\. Qualification**

* **Decision factors:**  
  * Clear need for consultancy that may evolve into end-to-end build.  
  * Preference for opportunities where consultancy → pilot → full programme (ICAS model).  
* **Decision maker:** Andrew (sometimes consults with Debbie, co-director, but final decision is his).  
* **Current filter:** More selective than in early years. Looks for scalability potential.

LDS now applies clearer selection criteria to opportunities:

* Focus on projects with potential to scale into full programme development.  
* Prioritise long-term institutional partnerships over short-term consultancy.  
* Deprioritise tenders unless LDS has a clear differentiator.

---

**4\. Proposal / Tendering**

* **Proposals:**  
  * Always send a summary of understanding \+ potential offer.  
  * Push client to articulate: *“This is what we want to do.”*  
  * Formats: bespoke each time, no templates.  
  * Pricing:  
    * Consultancy \= day-rate based, sometimes retainer style.  
    * Development \= increasingly fixed-cost packages.  
* **Tenders:**  
  * Involved in some, but not preferred.  
  * Challenges: competing with big offshore providers, pricing pressure, uncertain win rate.  
  * Strategy: stick to true cost \+ margin, avoid undercutting.  
* **Tools:** Proposals built in Word, on letterhead; emails and folders for tracking.

---

**5\. Negotiation & Agreement**

* **Channels:**  
  * Direct with key stakeholder (provost, dean, etc.).  
  * If agency is involved, they handle financial negotiation.  
* **Scope/Timeline/Budget lock:**  
  * Move from proposal → contract.  
  * Contract includes deliverables, timelines, schedules, financials.  
* **Subcontractors:** Not involved at negotiation stage.

---

**6\. Handover to Onboarding**

* **Trigger:** Contract signing \+ introduction to operational team.  
* **Current practice:**  
  * Scope/timelines/financials in contract (high-level).  
  * Contacts/responsibilities established informally during conversations.  
  * For large projects: build internal playbook (capturing key decisions, responsibilities, roles, effort levels, contacts).  
  * Historically developed playbooks a few months into project — would prefer to have onboarding questionnaire ready upfront.

---

**7\. Tracking & Follow-up**

* **Current state:**  
  * Largely in Andrew’s head, sometimes Debbie assists.  
  * No system for pipeline tracking (CRM absent).  
* **Needs:**  
  * Track warm/cold leads, delayed leads, lost opportunities.  
  * Reminders to follow up.  
  * Visibility on future pipeline to avoid gaps.  
* Opportunity documentation currently stored in structured **email folders** within Andrew’s inbox.  
* **Future aspiration:** migrate references into a CRM or Asana for visibility and delegation.

---

**8\. Pain Points**

* No CRM or systematisation.  
* Leads can go cold due to slow HE decision-making (committees, tiered structures).  
* Risk of losing opportunities by not following up systematically.  
* Pipeline management currently ad hoc and stressful.

---

**9\. Aspirations for Asana**

* Pipeline view (Lead → Contact → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed).  
* Automated follow-up reminders for warm/delayed leads.  
* Central record of proposals and conversations for visibility across team.

# Workflow 2: Client Onboarding / Initiation (Structured Draft) {#workflow-2:-client-onboarding-/-initiation-(structured-draft)}

### 1\. Trigger Point {#1.-trigger-point}

* The true “onboarding moment” is usually the **kick-off call with the operational team**, rather than just the signed contract.  
* Sometimes initiation conversations with stakeholders begin **before** the contract is fully signed.

---

### 2\. Kick-off Process {#2.-kick-off-process}

* Proactively engage with key people who will influence the project:  
  * 1–2 **core collaborators/knowledge owners**  
  * Wider group: digital education teams, learning technologists, academics (programme leads, deans), admin staff, marketing, student support.  
* Prefer **in-person kick-off meetings** at the client site if possible.  
* Kick-off attendees usually include:  
  * **Project sponsor** (main contact, identifies stakeholders)  
  * Head of digital education  
  * Operational leaders from faculties/schools  
  * Librarians  
* **Current approach:** Relies mostly on personal knowledge rather than a formal process.  
* **Gap identified:** Need for systematic questionnaires → playbooks → SOPs for consistency and scalability.

---

### 3\. Documentation {#3.-documentation}

* Typically **client provides key programme information** at this stage.  
* LDS documentation tends to start later in **programme planning** (plans, schedules, spreadsheets).  
* At onboarding: no standardised deliverables currently.  
* **Gap identified:** Should produce a clear statement of purpose/goals/deliverables as part of onboarding.  
* Storage: generally use **client’s systems**, not LDS’s.

---

### 4\. Roles & Responsibilities {#4.-roles-&-responsibilities}

* Sometimes uses a **RACI model** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) — but not consistent.  
* Roles usually clarified in early conversations:  
  * LDS: learning design \+ build (LDs, technologists)  
  * Client: SMEs, sometimes video production.  
* Approach is conversational and situational rather than systematic.  
* Onboarding responsibilities are currently defined through conversations with client stakeholders.  
* LDS has not yet standardised this into a repeatable RACI model or checklist.  
* Future SOPs could include:  
  * Standard onboarding questionnaire.  
  * RACI template to clarify responsibilities.  
  * Playbook reference to ensure alignment with programme management (Workflow 3).  
* **Gap identified:** Need a more structured method of explicitly agreeing responsibilities early.

---

### 5\. Communication Setup {#5.-communication-setup}

* Early conversations establish communication channels and file-sharing systems.  
* Access for subcontractors can be problematic (scaling access on/off).  
* Regular check-ins are scheduled with key stakeholder (weekly or bi-weekly).  
* Information is then cascaded by Andrew rather than via large group meetings.

---

### 6\. Resource Planning {#6.-resource-planning}

* Based on the **nature of the project**:  
  * Amount of online content vs activity design.  
  * Level and quality of media production required.  
* Decisions generally established during contracting phase.  
* Resource needs are drawn from experience, not a metrics-based model.  
* SMEs always provided by the university; LDS has never supplied SMEs.  
* **Gap identified:** Could benefit from resource planning templates or metrics to estimate effort.

---

### 7\. Alignment with Client Team {#7.-alignment-with-client-team}

* Early **teaching and learning strategy meeting** with key stakeholders (academics, technologists, librarians, etc.) is important.  
* Explores: *What does good online learning look like for your institution?*  
* Leads to agreements on capacity and responsibilities.  
* Uses RACI models when possible to formalise this.  
* For SMEs: collaborative onboarding process, module by module.  
* Growing recognition that **training and support** for SMEs is essential, not optional.

---

### 8\. Pain Points {#8.-pain-points-1}

* Much of onboarding is currently **in Andrew’s head** rather than formalised.  
* Lack of systematic steps, procedures, or templates.  
* Initial onboarding at institutional level doesn’t always cascade effectively to **module/project level onboarding**.  
* Risks: gaps in clarity, delays when roles or responsibilities aren’t clearly defined.

### 9\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 2: {#9.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-2:}

* Standardised onboarding checklist for each new client/project.  
* Task assignments for collecting roles, responsibilities, and contact details.  
* Shared space for storing playbooks/questionnaire responses.

# Workflow 3: Programme Management (Global Oversight – Final Draft) {#workflow-3:-programme-management-(global-oversight-–-final-draft)}

### 1\. Scope & Definition {#1.-scope-&-definition}

* Programme management \= **general oversight of the whole end-to-end development process** across multiple modules/projects.  
* Key success factor: Andrew’s ability to manage different resources and activities in parallel, ensuring courses are delivered successfully.  
* This sits above individual module development cycles and includes:  
  * Global scheduling and calendars  
  * Resource allocation (LDS subcontractors \+ client SMEs)  
  * Oversight of quality and timelines  
  * Issue/risk management

---

### 2\. Programme Planning {#2.-programme-planning}

* Use a **development waterfall** approach.  
* Start from each course’s **first delivery date** → map backwards by minimum 4 months (or agreed development duration).  
* Build a master calendar in a **large spreadsheet**.  
* Each module has milestones and dependencies mapped in detail (e.g. storyboards, builds, reviews, QA).

---

### 3\. Resource Allocation {#3.-resource-allocation}

* Decision based on **budget and profitability**:  
  * Onshore vs offshore allocation depends on client’s fee tolerance and LDS profit margin.  
  * Often a hybrid model (some modules UK LDs, some offshore).  
* Balancing workloads: not currently capacity-modelled, but guided by costings and availability.

---

### 4\. Coordination with Client {#4.-coordination-with-client}

* **Andrew owns programme management.**  
* Client does not usually provide programme-level oversight — LDS drives it.  
* Coordination of calendars, dependencies, and SME availability is handled at onboarding and maintained throughout.

---

### 5\. Oversight & Monitoring {#5.-oversight-&-monitoring}

* **Weekly reporting from LDs** into the master spreadsheet (status updates per module).  
* Andrew and Senior LD (Nicole) collaborate to review reports and flag issues.  
* SMEs’ responsiveness and input monitored through these updates.  
* Issues raised by LDs are escalated quickly for resolution.  
* Weekly updates from LDs are reviewed by Andrew and the SLD.  
* Oversight role is shifting towards the SLD to free Andrew for programme-level planning and business development.

---

### 6\. Quality Assurance {#6.-quality-assurance}

* QA stages are agreed with the client at the outset.  
* Standard approach: **three academic quality checks** (client responsibility).  
* LDS focus: **learning design quality** of storyboards, plans, and built content.  
* QA carried out by Andrew or Nicole (SLD).  
* QA is increasingly supported by the SLD, reducing Andrew’s direct oversight.  
* LDS is considering adopting the QA checklist approach trialled by LearningMate (see Workflow 4).  
* Cross-linking QA standards between programme management and module development would improve consistency.  
* **Gap identified:** Lack of formal QA checklists → need to develop.

---

### 7\. Issue Management {#7.-issue-management}

* LDs flag issues (e.g. SME non-participation) quickly; clients also escalate issues directly.  
* SME dropouts managed through collaborative discussions with client; sometimes need to add LDS or client-side extra resource.  
* Buffering helps absorb unpredictable changes, but “just-in-time” developments are more fragile.  
* Approach: always **collegial and collaborative escalation** with client stakeholders.

---

### 8\. Tools & Documentation {#8.-tools-&-documentation}

* Primary tools: **spreadsheets**, shared drives (SharePoint, Teams, Google Drive if client prefers).  
* Programme plans stored in client systems, not LDS-owned space.  
* **Templates:** limited — no consistent, standardised programme plan templates yet.  
* **Future aspiration:** programme documentation mapped into a single shared LDS repository (not only client drives) to preserve institutional knowledge and support delegation.

### 9\. Pain Points {#9.-pain-points}

* Managing “all the plates spinning” across 20+ concurrent modules.  
* Risk increases with scale and multiple overlapping projects.  
* **Biggest risk factor: SME availability and reliability.**  
* Current system \= manual, time-intensive, heavily reliant on Andrew’s oversight.  
* Desire for Asana:  
  * Portfolio-level view of all modules  
  * Resource tracking across UK/offshore teams  
  * Milestone monitoring and alerts  
  * Automated reminders and reporting

---

### 10\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 3:

* Dashboard showing all modules and milestones in one programme view.  
* Integrated QA checklists for module sign-offs.  
* Issue log to track escalations and resolutions.  
* **Future aspiration:** structure programme documentation into an **Asana hierarchy** (Portfolio → Programme → Project → Tasks) for visibility, reporting, and scalability.

# Workflow 4: Project / Module Development (Final Draft) {#workflow-4:-project-/-module-development-(final-draft)}

### 1\. Scope & Roles {#1.-scope-&-roles}

* **LD (Learning Designer)**: pedagogic lead \+ project manager for module.  
* **MA (Module Author / SME)**: subject expertise, writes/reviews content.  
* **SLD (Senior Learning Designer)**: QA and consistency across modules.  
* **LT (Learning Technologist)**: build and media editing.  
* **PM (Andrew)**: programme oversight, escalation, resourcing.  
* **Client roles**: Academic Lead, Programme Leaders, Librarian, Editorial, Digital Learning team.

---

### 2\. Development Cycle (Baseline: Walbrook 16-Week Model) {#2.-development-cycle-(baseline:-walbrook-16-week-model)}

* **Initiation & Planning (Weeks 0–3):** Pre-kick-off prep, questionnaire, initiation meetings, MPD, assessment briefs, reading list.  
* **Storyboarding (Weeks 4–12):** Weekly storyboards, sign-offs, academic reviews, filming (batch 1 & 2).  
* **Completion (Weeks 13–16):** QA reviews, editorial, handover, launch readiness.

---

### 3\. Exceptions & Variations {#3.-exceptions-&-variations}

* **Different clients:**  
  * ICAS: heavier on reviews.  
  * AUB/Dyson: cycles may be shorter (e.g. 10 weeks) or adjusted.  
  * Future clients: intended to follow Walbrook-style model with AI integrated.  
* **Cycle adjustments:**  
  * More media-heavy projects \= longer timelines (extra storyboard weeks, filming stages).  
* **Late/unavailable SMEs:**  
  * LD raises with Andrew → Andrew escalates to client lead.  
  * Options: nudge SME back in, replace SME, or LDS drafts with AI \+ new SME reviews.  
  * Example: current case where LDS is authoring full course from SME resources with AI.  
* **Concurrent crunch points:**  
  * Always happening (multiple completions at once).  
  * Prioritisation \= courses with the nearest live date get resources first.  
  * May add extra subcontractors if absolutely needed.  
* Plan to **map a completed client project** (e.g. ICAS or Walbrook) to extract templates, checklists, and document structures for reuse in future projects.

---

### 4\. AI Integration {#4.-ai-integration}

* **Standardisation:**  
  * Training delivered by Andrew (live Zoom \+ recorded).  
  * Prompt libraries, templates, and ongoing guidance via Andrew/SLD.  
* **Efficiency gains:**  
  * **Storyboarding** \= biggest impact.  
  * Case studies \+ assessment briefs \= faster drafting.  
  * LD effort reduced by \~50%.  
  * SME time reduced to \~25% of what it used to be.  
* **Limitations:**  
  * SME “voice” — if SMEs don’t edit AI drafts, tone may feel off.  
  * LDS encourages SMEs to script their own microlectures \+ key teaching text.

---

### 5\. Communication & Oversight {#5.-communication-&-oversight}

* **Andrew vs SLD:**  
  * Andrew still involved in reviewing storyboards/builds, but trying to shift QA role more to SLD (Nicole).  
  * Goal: free Andrew for programme planning \+ new business.  
* **Reporting:**  
  * Weekly status spreadsheet (master tracker with lines for each module).  
  * Walbrook also uses Monday.com (mirrored by LDs).  
  * Other clients: adapt to their tools, or propose new (e.g. Asana in future).  
  * Reporting tailored to each client’s expectations.

---

### 6\. Quality Assurance {#6.-quality-assurance-1}

* **Learning design QA:**  
  * Ongoing reviews by Andrew \+ SLD.  
  * Review storyboards, module builds, assessments.  
* **Client QA:**  
  * Academic reviewer \+ Programme Leader (content, syllabus).  
  * Editorial team (proofreading, corrections).  
* **Consistency across LDs:**  
  * Example-based training (share storyboards \+ built courses).  
  * Onboarding and continuous monitoring.  
* **Gap:**  
  * No LDS-wide QA checklist yet.  
  * **Action:** adopt/review LearningMate checklist → adapt into LDS QA checklist.  
* Consistency is supported by:  
  * Onboarding LDs with examples of built courses and storyboards.  
  * Active oversight by SLD and Andrew.  
* A formal LDS QA checklist is still to be developed (linked to Workflows 3 and 5).

---

### 7\. Completion & Handover {#7.-completion-&-handover}

* **Launch readiness:** module signed off by MA \+ logged in tracker.  
* **Post-launch issues:**  
  * Currently owned by client (no maintenance contracts yet).  
  * LDS would only manage fixes if contractually agreed.  
* **Feedback loops:**  
  * Structured feedback collection \= client’s responsibility.  
  * Universities systematically gather student data.  
* LDS does not currently gather structured post-launch feedback.  
* LDS does not currently manage post-launch maintenance unless separately contracted.  
* No structured feedback loop beyond client-side student surveys (see Workflow 8 for closeout/follow-up gaps).

---

### 8\. Pain Points {#8.-pain-points-2}

* Dependence on SME availability (biggest recurring risk).  
* Multiple concurrent deadlines \= resource crunch.  
* Oversight still heavily dependent on Andrew (unsustainable as scale grows).  
* QA processes inconsistent across clients/LDs.  
* Reporting fragmented across spreadsheets \+ client tools.

---

### 9\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 4 {#9.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-4}

* Standard template for 16-week (or shorter) module development cycles.  
* Automated reminders for SME deadlines and review stages.  
* Central repository for QA checklists and sign-offs.  
* Replace/augment Monday.com \+ spreadsheets.  
* Standardised template for 16-week cycle (or shorter cycles for other clients).  
* Portfolio view across modules.  
* Resource allocation visibility (onshore vs offshore).  
* Automated reminders (e.g. SME deadlines, reviews).  
* Client-facing dashboards for transparency.

# Workflow 5: Team & Resource Management  {#workflow-5:-team-&-resource-management}

### 1\. Team Composition {#1.-team-composition}

* **Current model:**  
  * Only permanent employee \= Andrew.  
  * All other roles subcontracted: LDs, SLDs, LTs, SLTs, video editors.  
* **Future direction:**  
  * May offer permanent employment for long-term/critical roles (e.g. current SLD).  
  * Subcontracting provides flexibility and scalability.

---

### 2\. Recruitment & Onboarding {#2.-recruitment-&-onboarding}

* **Recruitment methods:**  
  * Known/trusted freelancers from previous work (first choice).  
  * UK-based agencies (supply LDs/LTs at UK rates).  
  * Offshore agencies (India & South Africa — mixed quality: India weaker, South Africa stronger).  
  * LinkedIn open callouts → high volume, filtered by interviews.  
* **Agency trade-off:** convenient but subcontractors earn less.  
* **Onboarding process:**  
  * Currently project-specific rather than centralised.  
  * Includes: onboarding meetings, training sessions (recorded), templates, process descriptions, playbooks.  
  * Documentation stored in Google Drive (internal) and SharePoint (client).

---

### 3\. Assignment of Work {#3.-assignment-of-work}

* **Basis:** availability \+ cost.  
* **Capacity assumptions:** e.g. Walbrook \= \~10 hrs/week per LD.  
* **Constraints:** most subcontractors have other employment → can only take 1–2 modules max.  
* **Allocation principles:**  
  * Start with trusted, known resources.  
  * Reuse resources for consistency and efficiency.  
  * Balance UK vs offshore (e.g. 50–50 split) to meet client fee expectations and maintain margins.  
* **Risks:**  
  * Offshore Indian LDs have underperformed.  
  * South African resources generally effective.  
* Allocation decisions also link to financial modelling (see Workflow 7).  
* Balancing UK and offshore resources ensures client affordability while maintaining LDS margins.

---

### 4\. Tracking Capacity & Workload {#4.-tracking-capacity-&-workload}

* **Current state:**  
  * Informal → based on conversations and email trails of staff availability.  
  * Master tracking via development waterfalls \+ weekly status reports.  
* **Gap:**  
  * No centralised utilisation sheet showing resource, availability, and hours against dates.  
  * Would benefit from a resourcing map.

---

### 5\. Communication with Subcontractors {#5.-communication-with-subcontractors}

* **Mechanisms:**  
  * Onboarding/training meetings (live \+ recorded).  
  * Templates, tools, and process guides.  
  * Playbook (key information sets for LDs).  
* **Check-ins:**  
  * Weekly reports from LDs.  
  * Regular check-ins with Andrew or SLD.  
* **Standards:**  
  * Communicated through training \+ ongoing reviews.  
* Ensure subcontractors and deputies (Nicole, Steve) have **shared drive access** to reference materials and templates, not only client-owned systems.

---

### 6\. Quality Monitoring {#6.-quality-monitoring}

* **Responsibility:**  
  * Historically Andrew reviewed all outputs.  
  * Increasingly SLD (Nicole) handles QA.  
* **Methods:**  
  * Weekly reporting, review of outputs, informal oversight.  
* **Gap:**  
  * No formal QA checklists (though LearningMate has one that could be adopted/adapted).  
* QA currently depends on active review by Andrew and the SLD.  
* A formal QA checklist is being considered (linked to Workflows 3 and 4).

---

### 7\. Scaling Up or Down {#7.-scaling-up-or-down}

* **Scaling method:**  
  * Subcontracting model allows quick scaling.  
  * Start with trusted bench of freelancers.  
  * Add new staff via agencies or LinkedIn callouts as needed.  
* **Goal:** expand bench over time to reduce reliance on unknown hires.

---

### 8\. Retention & Relationships {#8.-retention-&-relationships}

* **Methods:**  
  * Supporting subcontractors with information \+ good relationships.  
  * Paying fairly and promptly.  
  * Offering repeat work.  
  * Opportunities for growth (e.g. Nicole promoted from LD → SLD, potential PM role in future).

---

### 9\. Pain Points {#9.-pain-points-1}

* **Biggest challenges:**  
  * Number of people → “spinning plates” problem.  
  * Bringing in new subcontractors \= risk.  
  * Quality \= main breakdown point (expectations not always met).  
* **Burn rate:** \~12.5% of new subcontractors fail to meet standard and must be replaced.  
* **Need from Asana:**  
  * Standardised resourcing tracker.  
  * Visibility of subcontractor availability \+ allocation.  
  * Easier mapping of who to assign to future projects.

### 10\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 5: {#10.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-5:}

* Resource tracker showing subcontractor availability and workload.  
* Mapping of modules/projects to assigned LDs and LTs.  
* Visibility of quality reviews and approvals.

# Workflow 6: Ongoing Client Management  {#workflow-6:-ongoing-client-management}

### 1\. Regular Updates {#1.-regular-updates}

* **Mechanisms:**  
  * Weekly reporting spreadsheet in client’s shared drive (e.g. SharePoint at Walbrook).  
  * Each LD updates their module’s weekly status.  
  * Weekly meeting with key sponsor/operational stakeholder (Provost/Academic Lead at Walbrook; admins/managers at other clients).  
* **Format:** Mix of spreadsheet visibility \+ direct conversation.  
* **Frequency:** Weekly at minimum, plus ad hoc as required.

---

### 2\. Formal vs Informal Communication {#2.-formal-vs-informal-communication}

* **Check-ins:**  
  * Often regular weekly/biweekly meetings, sometimes scheduled, sometimes informally arranged.  
  * Walbrook: informally on Fridays.  
* **Channels:**  
  * LDS prefers Zoom.  
  * Clients typically use Teams.  
  * Emails remain core channel.

---

### 3\. Issue Escalation {#3.-issue-escalation}

* **Process:**  
  * Andrew raises issues directly via email with sponsor/operational stakeholder.  
  * If relevant, also contacts programme leader or other workstream leadership.  
* **Escalation:**  
  * Normally stops with operational stakeholder but can escalate to senior leadership if responses don’t align with agreed commitments.  
* **Approach:** Direct, professional, and anchored in initial agreements.  
* **Future aspiration:** maintain a **central log of communications and escalations** within Asana, linked to client stakeholders.  
* **Desired support:** shared issues tracker visible across both LDS and client stakeholders to avoid fragmented escalation.

---

### 4\. Change Requests / Scope Creep {#4.-change-requests-/-scope-creep}

* **Identification:** Based on visibility of scope against contract schedules.  
* **Response:**  
  * Additional work is costed.  
  * Generally handled informally rather than through formal re-contracting.  
  * If SME issues cause delays, Andrew flags timeline risks and potential extra LD cost.  
* **Protection of timelines:**  
  * Core focus \= delivery date for module launch.  
  * Adjustments: extend development project OR accelerate with extra resourcing.

---

### 5\. Relationship Management {#5.-relationship-management}

* **Trust:** Built early through direct engagement with senior stakeholders, maintained through consistent, honest communication.  
* **Positioning:** Andrew acts not only as a project manager but also a **strategic consultant/adviser** on online education.  
* **Value:**  
  * LDS provides expertise not available in-house.  
  * Deliverables themselves (modules launching on schedule with high learner experience quality) make value visible.

---

### 6\. Multi-Stakeholder Management {#6.-multi-stakeholder-management}

* **Approach:**  
  * Work primarily through sponsor/operational stakeholder for coordination.  
  * They manage or advise across groups.  
  * Communication cascades to broader groups of stakeholders (digital education, academics, librarians, marketing, etc.).  
* **Andrew’s role:** Oversight of all streams, ensuring alignment, timely contributions.  
* This stage is where Andrew’s advisory/consulting role is most visible.  
* Adds value by helping institutions align multiple internal teams towards a coherent online education strategy.

---

### 7\. End-of-Phase Reviews {#7.-end-of-phase-reviews}

* **Current practice:** None formally in place.  
* **Gap identified:** Would benefit from structured checkpoints/reviews during long projects (e.g. quarterly).  
* Introducing structured reviews would provide a bridge between live delivery (Workflow 6\) and final closeout (Workflow 8).

---

### 8\. Pain Points {#8.-pain-points-3}

* **Challenges:**  
  * High volume and scope of communication needed.  
  * Large institutions \= uneven engagement across departments (some see online as core, others peripheral).  
  * Delays often arise from slow responses in less-engaged units.  
* **Mitigation:** Strong senior management buy-in, representative teams to reduce bottlenecks.  
* **Needs from Asana:**  
  * Centralised comms records.  
  * Clear tracking of roles/responsibilities.  
  * Issue log \+ resolution tracking.  
  * Dashboard visibility for client and LDS.

### 9\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 6: {#9.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-6:}

* Central log of issues raised and resolutions.  
* Client-facing dashboards showing progress updates.  
* Records of communications and stakeholder responsibilities.

# Workflow 7: Finance & Operations  {#workflow-7:-finance-&-operations}

### 1\. Pricing & Budgeting {#1.-pricing-&-budgeting}

* **Consultancy:**  
  * Standard day rate: £800/day (sometimes negotiated down to £600).  
  * Typical engagement \= \~1 day/week for 3 months, invoiced monthly.  
  * Trend: moving towards fixed-fee consultancy (e.g. £30k project price rather than days × rate).  
* **Development projects:**  
  * Role-based estimation: LDs, LTs, SLDs, SLTs, video editors.  
  * Standard assumptions (Walbrook example):  
    * LD: \~20–22 days/module (16 weeks, 10 hrs/week).  
    * LT: \~26 days/module (8 weeks build \+ interactivity \+ video editing).  
    * SLD: \~0.5 day/week/module \= \~8 days total.  
    * SLT: \~1 day/module.  
  * Rates: hybrid of UK \+ offshore subcontractors, adjusted for AI efficiency gains.  
  * Invoicing model: originally based on **actuals** (subcontractor days logged) but moving toward **deliverables-based invoicing** (per-module cost divided across four milestones).

---

### 2\. Cost Modelling {#2.-cost-modelling}

* **Margin:** subcontractor costs \+ \~20%.  
* **Balancing:** hybrid model (e.g. 50% UK, 50% offshore).  
* **Tension:** discomfort setting a client rate that doesn’t cover most expensive UK subcontractor costs.  
* **Tools:** currently no profit margin spreadsheets or systematic modelling — would benefit from one.  
* Estimates increasingly factor in AI efficiency gains.  
  * LD workload reduced by \~50% through AI-assisted drafting.  
  * SME input time reduced further, improving delivery speed.  
* This impacts how LDS models subcontractor hours and overall project costs.

---

### 3\. Contracting & Payment Terms {#3.-contracting-&-payment-terms}

* **Contracts include schedules:** outlining cost build-up and overall totals.  
* **Current practice:**  
  * Monthly invoicing (end of month) with 30-day terms.  
  * No upfront payments at present.  
* **Future aspiration:** staged payments (e.g. 50% upfront, 25% mid-point, 25% completion).

---

### 4\. Invoicing Process {#4.-invoicing-process}

* **Tool:** FreeAgent (accounting \+ invoicing).  
* **Workflow:** generates invoice in FreeAgent → sends to Andrew first → then sent manually to client.  
* **Tracking:** FreeAgent automatically tracks payments and flags overdue invoices.  
* Need a **reconciliation mechanism** to map subcontractor invoices against client invoices (currently managed manually).

---

### 5\. Cashflow Management {#5.-cashflow-management}

* **Method:** monthly invoicing aligned to subcontractor invoicing (also monthly, 30-day terms).  
* **Effect:** reduces liquidity risk as long as clients pay promptly.  
* **Exposure:** LDS carries risk if client delays, as contractors expect timely payment.

---

### 6\. Profit First Allocations {#6.-profit-first-allocations}

* **Bank:** transitioning from NatWest → Starling to enable Profit First structure.  
* **Spaces set up:** Income, Operating Expenses, Owner’s Compensation, Profit, Tax, VAT.  
* **Allocations:** done monthly once invoices are paid, based on agreed % or fixed amounts.  
* **Oversight:** Debbie (co-director) manages allocations.

---

### 7\. Financial Oversight & Reporting {#7.-financial-oversight-&-reporting}

* **Current state:** no systematic tracking of project-level profitability.  
* **Annual reports:** prepared by accountant.  
* **Emerging practice:**  
  * Debbie increasingly active in oversight.  
  * Monitors margins and Profit First allocations.  
  * Tracks margins and financial health alongside the accountant’s annual reporting.  
* **Gap:** need project-level financial visibility (invoices out vs invoices in vs subcontractor costs).

---

### 8\. Pain Points {#8.-pain-points-4}

* **Quoting complexity:**  
  * Consultancy \= simple (day rate).  
  * Development projects \= complex (multi-role estimates, balancing UK/offshore rates, AI savings).  
* **Margin clarity:** currently inconsistent; sometimes under- or over-estimating role hours.  
* **Cashflow risk:** reliance on client promptness.  
* **Invoice mapping:** need systematic way to reconcile subcontractor invoices vs client invoices across multiple projects.  
* **Tooling:** not clear if Asana is right; might need a dedicated finance/project tracking tool to complement Asana.

---

### 9\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 7 {#9.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-7}

* Asana could help by linking **deliverables → invoicing milestones**.  
* Would need integration or manual mapping to finance tools (FreeAgent).  
* Ideal: dashboard showing project/module deliverables, subcontractor costs, invoice schedule, and margin visibility.  
* Asana licensing to be tied to **LDS organisational email domain**. Paid seats may be required for API access. Possible use of a separate service domain for integrations.

# Workflow 8: Closeout & Follow-up {#workflow-8:-closeout-&-follow-up}

### 1\. Project Closeout {#1.-project-closeout}

* **Current practice:** entirely informal.  
* No structured closeout process (no checklists, no final meetings, no sign-off forms).  
* Typically ends with informal recognition: “Great job, we finished.”  
* No structured sign-off currently in place.  
* Would benefit from a closeout checklist confirming:  
  * Deliverables complete and accepted.  
  * Handover package provided to client.  
  * Internal review captured.  
* **Gap:** would benefit from a defined closeout protocol.  
* Mapping of past projects (e.g. ICAS) can support **structured closeout**, asset organisation, and creation of reusable templates for future clients.  
* **Future aspiration:** formalised closeout checklist, structured client feedback tracker, and scheduled follow-ups managed in Asana.

---

### 2\. Handover to Client {#2.-handover-to-client}

* **Current approach:** clean handover.  
* No ongoing maintenance or delivery support.  
* All final course documentation and outputs remain on client systems (e.g. SharePoint).  
* **Gap:** no LDS-created end-of-project package or handover report.

---

### 3\. Internal Wrap-up {#3.-internal-wrap-up}

* No internal reviews currently conducted.  
* No systematic lessons-learned capture or retrospective.  
* **Gap:** opportunity to run internal project reviews to improve future workflows.

---

### 4\. Feedback Gathering {#4.-feedback-gathering}

* **Clients:** feedback limited to requesting testimonials (e.g. case studies).  
* **Subcontractors:** no feedback process at present.  
* **Gap:** no formal mechanism for structured feedback from either clients or subcontractors.

---

### 5\. Relationship Maintenance {#5.-relationship-maintenance}

* **Current practice:** ad hoc check-ins (occasional emails, tagging contacts in LinkedIn posts).  
* Example: post-ICAS project (end 2024\) → sporadic exchanges only.  
* **Ideas for improvement:** client newsletter to maintain visibility and engagement.  
* **Gap:** no structured client engagement plan post-project.

---

### 6\. Re-engagement Strategy {#6.-re-engagement-strategy}

* **Current state:** no CRM, no systematic follow-up.  
* Informal reliance on being “known and remembered” by past clients.  
* **Gap:** no pipeline of follow-on work, no reminder system for outreach.  
* A systematic approach could include:  
  * Scheduled reminders for follow-ups.  
  * Client engagement campaigns.  
  * Central log of past client interactions (linked to Workflow 1).

---

### 7\. Pain Points {#7.-pain-points}

* Lack of structure in closure and follow-up.  
* Projects “just stop” without a formal closure process.  
* No consistent method for:  
  * Confirming deliverables complete.  
  * Tracking post-launch issues.  
  * Keeping relationships warm.  
* **Desired support:**  
  * Closeout checklist.  
  * Client feedback tracker.  
  * Follow-up reminders (CRM or Asana).

### 8\. Aspirations for Asana in Workflow 8: {#8.-aspirations-for-asana-in-workflow-8:}

* Closeout checklist with assigned responsibilities.  
* Client feedback tracker (surveys/testimonials).  
* Automated reminders for scheduled follow-ups.
