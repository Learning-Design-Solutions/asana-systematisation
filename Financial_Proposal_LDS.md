# Financial Proposal for Learning Design Solutions

## Prepared by Serenichron

### Date: September 24, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction & Overview

This proposal outlines a structured engagement designed to implement the key operational improvements identified in the Phase 1 strategy for Learning Design Solutions (LDS). Our approach is to break down the implementation into distinct, manageable projects, each with a fixed fee and a clear set of deliverables. This ensures transparency, predictable budgeting, and visible return on investment at each stage.

We will structure this engagement as a **Phased Project-Based Retainer**, where each project is paid for via a monthly retainer over its defined duration. This model provides a clear roadmap for our collaboration and allows for incremental investment as LDS builds its operational foundation for scalable growth.

## 3. Payment Terms

*   **Upfront Deposit:** A 30% deposit of the total fixed fee for each project is required to commence work. This deposit secures your project in our schedule and allows us to allocate the necessary resources.
*   **Monthly Retainer:** The remaining 70% of the project fee is then divided into equal monthly installments over the project's duration. This creates a predictable and manageable payment schedule.
*   **Invoicing:** Invoices for the monthly retainer will be sent on the 1st of each month and are payable within 15 days.

**Example for Project 2 (SOP Development & Workflow Automation Pilot):**
*   **Total Fixed Fee:** £3,000
*   **Upfront Deposit (30%):** £900 (due upon signing)
*   **Remaining Balance:** £2,100
*   **Monthly Retainer:** £1,050 per month for 2 months

## 4. Work Kick-off Plan

1.  **Agreement & NDA:** Upon agreement of this proposal, we will finalise a standard Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure the confidentiality of all shared information.
2.  **Account Sharing:** Secure sharing of necessary account access (e.g., Loom, ScribeHow, Asana) will be arranged after the NDA is in place.
3.  **Initial Discovery Session:** We will schedule a 2-hour discovery session to deep-dive into the first project, confirm priorities, and establish a detailed timeline.
4.  **Commencement:** Work on the first project will commence immediately following the discovery session.
