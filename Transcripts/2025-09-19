0:00 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  A of operational duties. So it's been very intense.

0:07 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, I bet. I bet. Well, you got it done. That's a good thing. Are you actually eating properly? Are you eating again?

0:15 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I mean, yes, but also I'm prioritizing my, you know, my regimen. So I'm Wednesdays and Fridays. Oh, yeah, of course.  Fasting days.

0:26 - Andrew Doig
  Fasting days, yeah. Yeah.

0:28 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So today, just coffee and water. Yeah.

0:33 - Andrew Doig
  Well, you look bright and fresh with it. So that's good. In terms of what I've been doing constructively, I mean, I have been recording somewhere all of my days with Loom.  I haven't really worked out what I'm then doing with the Loom recordings. You know, I've just been collating them.  I haven't started today, actually. I'll start that soon as we finish the call. Other than that, I haven't had a lot of time for thinking.  How do strategically thinking about SOPs or anything much like that? I've been doing a lot of day-to-day business as usual.

1:07 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  In many respects, I realize I've been directing you and guiding you to do these things without the obvious clear follow-up.  Now, the follow-up will be born out of the strategy. So there is a follow-up to be done, and it also ties into the process for systematizing your business operations.  You're not necessarily going to be the person that executes on the follow-up. That's more of a project management expertise specialist kind of thing.  So whether you opt to employ us to do the follow-up or want to train internally, maybe you want to train your son, right?  These become operational processes that you integrate into your day-to-day. As time continues to flow, these will become habits that you cultivate within the business and when it's no longer your turn to keep doing them because you've already codified the things on your end, they will be things that people that are employed and carry out specialist duties should still continue to do as their operational workflows continue to evolve and these SOPs need to become updated and stay up to date.  Sure.

2:32 - Andrew Doig
  So can we recap then where are we at now and what are the things that have to happen next?

2:38 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So I've been updating the two documents that we work off of. That is the simplified Phase 1 implementation plan for one and the overall strategy to reflect the changes, right?  The changes in vision. Thank you. Reprioritization of what is important. So I'm delivering those to you today. I still have to carry out, because I keep them locally, I process them locally, and then I update the remote document.

3:16 - Andrew Doig
  They're mostly finished.

3:20 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I can show you the updated phase one implementation plan, and we can discuss it now. The actual strategy will be ready a bit later.  To the extent that we are at a point where further changes are not necessary. Now, for the strategy, I'm still actually waiting on some documentations from your part, because we need to integrate those into the strategy.  We need to do a summary analysis of them. But to the extent where we're confident that that's the strategy that we're going to go off of, and the direction is not likely to...  We move on to the phase where we begin to execute on the priorities, right? So we set up the framework under which we will go forward with the SLP development and documentation, project and tool management over time, how you begin to delegate and what the clear rules to do so are, how you will approach the financial management and optimizations.

4:31 - Andrew Doig
  So that makes me think two things, maybe three things. One is I think it would be good for you to kind of present the strategy to Deb and I.  And that's probably, you know, this time next week, we'll get both of us on a call and you can talk us through what the strategy is.  I think I should make a focus in the next week in getting documentation to you that you need. So let's  Let's quickly review what that is. And I'll just have to build that into my week. And in terms of the financial management, as we now have a different bank account, Starling Bank, I've spoken to my accountant that there's no issues about swapping over to a new account.  So probably this weekend, well, once I've, from the account I use, I need to pay all my subcontractors, probably over the weekend going into Monday, but then we're going to swap bank accounts and we've got the various sub accounts set up for the profit first model and Debbie's managing that.  So in the next week, potentially, we can make the changes that get us to the ready to start the strategy point.  And that's good if I have a declared deadline to get things to you. I mean, I should have done this before, but life is life.  Then I can work ahead and do that. So tell me what... I've just written down on my notepad what Vlad needs from me.  What do you need from me? What are the things I haven't done yet? Okay.

6:08 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So, and this is to come to answer your question around what to do also with the SOPs and looms that you've been recording.  One of the parts of the updated strategy has to do, and this is actually a project management process workflow as well, the workflow and process by which you will now, going forward, take these kinds of recordings and transcripts and notes and break them down automatically into actionables.  that will then feed into your systems internally for assignments, review, confirmation, and delegation.

6:57 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah. I kind of need to know how to do that. Yes.

7:01 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Now to do that, there are different ways that we will be able to approach this. On my part, I use a two-tiered system.  I showed you a little bit of it before, where I have an interface locally that's configured to take in my instructions and then update our project management and check calendars, check for availability, schedule them, then come back to update the task with the new due dates, update the description with information, present them for review, and notify our assigned project manager to take on the tasks, and also notify the person that's assigned to execute in order to proceed, right?  I have an interface to do that, and then we also have an automated background workflow to be able to do some of that, the parts that are  Are the most efficient and mature, right? Not all of it is mature enough where we feel confident to fully leave it running automatically, but many parts of it are.  So the parts about intake of transcripts and notes and actionables, synthesis, and preparing the tasks, preparing the titles and descriptions and the calendars and everything, and then submitting them for review makes it so 90% of the workload is front-loaded, it's automated.  And then the project manager and the stakeholders really only have to review, validate, or provide additional feedback for changes, confirm, and then the rest of it, the actual updates, the actual assignments, and so on, are again automated.

8:59 - Andrew Doig
  So that all...

9:00 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I mean, it's about 90% of all project and task management.

9:03 - Andrew Doig
  But at this point in time, I am the stakeholder, or I mean, Deb, are the stakeholders. I mean, what I feel like I'm doing in terms of grabbing SOPs is building an infrastructure for the future, for as I grow to scale and I need to bring other people in.  Like, I am my project manager. I am my human resource department. I am all of those things. And at the moment, I have one project running, so it doesn't, you know, I'm not at a stage to bring in more roles.  However, you know, I have various threads of potential business that will quickly make me beyond capacity, at which point I will need to bring in those roles.  Yes.

9:47 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And so at the moment, you are the stakeholder, but you are not the only stakeholder. In fact, any delegate, right, so stakeholders include people that supply.  I input as well as people that are supposed to receive output, that includes your clients to an extent, it includes the partners to which you outsource or delegate to, right?  All of these entities are stakeholders in a given task or project, so the workflow needs to be created based on that concept, not just on you.  The second aspect is you have a currently running project, which is also kind of the best candidate to begin building the operational workflows on, because you don't want to be kicking off a fresh new paradigm on a fresh new project.  Sure. The way to do it is you continue to run your operational workflows, you begin or we begin to support you to build the parallel system.  begin  Natural. It takes begin are ...and that And as you execute, the parallel system does not go into production officially.  So you see what the parallel system produces in a separate, right, wherever you do your project and task management right now, which, if I remember correctly, is spreadsheets.  In parallel, you will see how the system begins to work in an automated fashion. And the components that match well can basically be validated.  We say, okay, that part is running up to spec. And you don't use it yet because when you run it, you need to run the whole thing.  But we move on to the second part. So let's say the decomposition of projects runs up to your spec.  We move on to the task generation, task definition, task schedule. Scheduling task assignment. Those go according to spec. We move on to communication and integration, right?  So making sure the tasks are able to be communicated both internally and to stakeholders as required. That gets to spec.  When everything is to spec, you begin to execute the actual further project and task management on the new system.  Yeah. That's the process, basically, the step-by-step that we want to walk you through in order to integrate that into your business.  And then when you kick off a new project, you already run it off of your to spec workflow. You don't have to learn it on the fly as you're already bogged down with existing tasks and new documentation and the like.

12:52 - Andrew Doig
  I mean, an important part of my workflow will be when I'm onboarding a new client in terms of tracking that because those are...  There's a very distinct workflow at that stage compared to the running of a project that is up. You know, there's a lot of tasks that involves developing strategy, developing confidence, putting processes in place, getting a playbook, for example, that's tailored to the specific client.  So I will need to be tracking and looking at all of those when I get to that stage. Okay, so I get all of that.  What I really need, though, are my actionables. What are the things that I can and could be doing to help us move towards that?

13:39 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Well, so on one hand, I need to see some of what you've been recording and the complexities in order to give you a rough estimate or timeline for what it might mean to implement.  I also need to agree with you. So there's two ways that this can be done. One of them is we agree a methodology for us to work on that together.  And I walk you through everything in terms of next steps. And, you know, what's the preferred pricing, how you want to handle it.  Of course, you can also request from others, although I don't know that at the moment. No, no, I'm not interested in requesting from others.

14:26 - Andrew Doig
  But what I need to understand is process costs and benefits. mean, I need to understand, I need it articulated in simple terms.  What would be the benefits of going down that? I know we've been talking about it, but I need it as a set of statements so that Deb and I can sit and reflect on it.  Yes, because, you know, I mean, I'm enjoying working with you. I think you're, you know, you're intelligent and articulate and you clearly know what you're doing.  So you and Senechron, I'd be happy to work. But I need to know that there's an investment there. need to know what the return on that investment is going to be, what the benefit is, what my short and long-term benefits will be.  Yeah.

15:10 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And in many ways, that actually follows from what you've been recording in some respects. Have you been recording actual process and operational workflows or more like one-offs?

15:23 - Andrew Doig
  I've just been starting recording at the beginning of my day and letting it run for a few hours. It has been cutting off after, I think, maybe four hours.  It stops recording itself. It's probably because of the free use that I'm making of it at the moment. But that's okay.  I mean, I'm really thinking tremendously about what I'm recording. I'm just recording my day. And my day this week has mostly been me responding to emails, firefighting, taking meetings, you know, doing...  ...the stuff that I do. And as I say, I haven't started it yet today, but I'll start... because I have quite a lot of things to be getting on with today, and I'll start recording again, and I've been looking insane and talking to the computer about what I'm doing at each stage, so there's an audio recording of that as well, so I am slowly collecting videos of that nature, I've only started probably Wednesday this week, I don't have a huge amount of it yet, Tuesday or Wednesday this week.

16:23 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  It's good enough, that means there are probably more than 15 hours of data in there to start to have a good sample size, and they are very much day-to-day operationals, which also allows us to capture some insight into how much individual operationals take.  Now, we haven't gotten you started on the time track, the explicit time tracking process yet, which is not going to be very complex, especially for your internal use, there's two ways we can go.  So about that, that I'd recommend, one is to leverage the time tracking integration of the project management software that I would recommend to you.  The caveat there is that that solution is pretty much just focused on time tracking. Another might be that we leverage a time tracking tool that is also very flexible in terms of integrating employees and has more functionality in terms of budgeting for projects, breaking down projects that you have quoted and estimated to clients into those milestones and timelines and expense projections and the like.  It's actually really, really good at that. And it would allow you when you move into the estimation phase for a client and you begin to break down the offer.  into timelines and milestones that you then translate that structure into the software and then once you're in the software and you and your employees or your delegates begin to execute on the project the time is logged precisely against the phases the tasks the milestones with exact time entries you are able to set the cost and billing of each time entry from each partner or delegate or or higher when reported to the project and then when you do your reporting whether to the client or internally you're able to have a very clear vision at a glance of I am this far through the project this much has been spent this much has been budgeted so I am you know like I am within 30% of budget I am within 80% of budget I and to do so so  on an individual milestone-by-milestone and task-by-task basis? Yeah.

19:05 - Andrew Doig
  How does that work? Because my tracking of the people that work for me is that at the end of the month, they give me an invoice that states how many days effort they've put into the project in that month.  I mean, I know how many days we are estimated for them to have effort. So there's not a closer breakdown than that.  It's just a monthly breakdown of effort on task. For now.

19:29 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Now, in a hypothetical future, I would recommend that as you get more projects, you continue to operate with your network of partners, that you agree with them to implement some additional methodologies.  And most of these methodologies really boil down to just, please, from now on, I have created an account for you in this software.  When you begin working on my projects, please log into the software. And look up the project, the, you know, the milestone and or the task and click start and just log for that given task or whatever you're doing.

20:16 - Andrew Doig
  I love that one. I'm just thinking of the nature of who I work with and who are comfortable with doing that.  I can discuss with a couple of the ones that I know and trust. Yes. We are in, as in a lot of, you know, contracting environment, we are independent operators.  And as such, you know, there's a degree of, and whether rightly or not, there's a degree of trust that the people you're employing are quoting you the hours that they do.  And the asking them to track in a system that I have, you know, ownership of that is a reporting system effectively when they're.  Not my employees when they're my subcontractor. I don't know what level of comfort people are going to have with that.  I mean, I would have to put out feelers and see how they feel about it. I'm just trying to think if I was in their situation, if I was contracting for a company and they were telling me to log my hours in a tracking software.  I wonder how I'd feel about that. Maybe it's fine. Maybe it's fine. I'll sit with that one. I need to think about it.

21:25 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Before you have that conversation, allow me to give you a frame of reference or positioning, because this is oftentimes actually a point of fear or friction where people feel as though they're being micromanaged or tracked too closely.  But in effect, you're already doing that exact thing with them because they still have to submit a record of hours.  They're just doing it in a very non-detailed way. And they can continue to do that same thing. You just ask them, hey.  For our operational processes, it's inefficient for you to send me a spreadsheet of this report. I would first prefer to ask you to do the exact same report that you're doing, but just do it in the software.  So if they're reporting this month, we have 100 hours logged, rather than sending that to you in a spreadsheet over email, ask them to log that they have worked 100 hours.  It's fine. It doesn't matter. They don't have to do it on a day-by-day basis. They don't have to do it on anything else, but just ask them to do it in the software.  And then also ask them for just that extra degree of resolution. So if they're working towards a specific milestone, just working towards a specific milestone, they know that they're working towards a specific milestone, ask them to select what they're working towards.  And that's it.

22:55 - Andrew Doig
  That then becomes kind of moot. If we go to pricing against deliverables, which actually about half of the subcontractors I've got just now are priced per project.  So we have a module development and rather than because of what's happened with the offshoring resources, both the offshore resources, because they were using far too many hours, we've gone to a price per project that's broken down to specific deliverables.  And then through an agency, I have subcontractors who are invoicing against four points of, it's a 16 week project.  Every four weeks, there's a fixed set of deliverables. We've met those deliverables, we'll get paid for the work. So that then becomes moot in terms of tracking.  There's only, and it's like, what is my, okay, you're shaking your head.

23:50 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And the reason it doesn't become moot is because no matter what happens, you are almost certainly going to keep having to...  You're still going to have to track somebody's time, whether it's your own or employees. For employees, you're not pricing them against deliverables.  You're still tracking their time. There will still be contractors who might not agree to pricing against deliverables, but they're still doing good work and you want to keep working with them.  So they'll still be tracking time. And the ones that do price against deliverables, you will still have them in exactly that same software, except instead of recording time towards a milestone, you will be recording an expense towards a milestone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's fine.

24:43 - Andrew Doig
  That's fine. That works. That works. Yeah, that all makes sense.

24:48 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And I believe, based on how we've engaged so far and what I've learned, that more than likely, this is the paradigm and the system to use, as opposed to just doing a time tracking integration in the project management.  Because this gives you that at-a-glance visibility, not just to produce reports for your clients and internally, but also to really keep track of profitability and margin and be able to optimize and to do so on the fly.

25:20 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah, that's making sense. So in terms of the Looms I've been recording, do you just want me just to continue recording and you will help me process?  Or is there a processing element I can be carrying out? Like, should I be taking the transcripts? Or is there a tool in Loom I can use?  You said they can segment out into different tasks to think about that. mean, it'd be worth me experimenting with it if it's something I can do.

25:44 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So the reason that I recommended that you already start paying for Loom, as opposed to... And you probably did because you wouldn't be able to record four-hour chunks if you didn't.  I'm pretty sure it stops at five minutes in the free plan. Yeah, probably on...

26:00 - Andrew Doig
  I think I'm on a free trial on a paid plan. Makes sense. Makes sense. That will run out soon and I'll start paying for it.

26:09 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Now, it is able to analyze and break down both the transcript as well as chapters inside video. So it's easy at a glance when you come in.  It gives you a summary. It gives you timestamps. It helps with some of that classification, but it will only do so much because after that, we still need or you still need to have a process where you extract that information and we perform analysis on it and really start to think of, okay, so many hours spent on this process, so many hours spent on that process.  So you begin to build your internal compass of both simply time cost requirement as well as process cost requirement overall.

26:59 - Andrew Doig
  And compare.

27:00 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  That against the complexity of making the correct decisions for a given process so that we can begin thinking of which of these processes is easier to delegate from a decision-making standpoint and how must those decisions be made, right?  Because in order to partially or fully automate these processes effectively, what you really need to automate is the input and output and the decision-making.  And that decision-making is what the AI helps us with. And we'll need to codify the decisions that you make.  Usually by having a set of rules, we will be building rules, long, long, long, long lists of rules. And the AI that is put into these processes will compare the inputs against the rules that you specify.  And use that as its decision maker so that it can produce the right output. Where we need to make sure that you have a good process over time is that you need to have a good process to implement additional rules and to modify prior rules so that it's not expensive to continue improving the decision making.  And that's the reason why I don't think you can do it yourself right now. Instead, we need to be looking both at the existing set of decisions that you've been making from these sets of recordings.  That's why it's also so critically important to record because otherwise, yes, you can start writing rules, but you're never really going to know all the rules unless you have a log of the rules that you have had, right?  The decisions that you have made.

28:58 - Andrew Doig
  Because a lot of what have been spent. This week, probably slightly different to a normal week because my senior subcontractor, Nicole, who's my senior learning designer, has been on leave.  So I've been doing a lot of her tasks, which involve looking at other people's work, checking it, correcting it, giving advice, catching up with them by email or verbally.  But with an ongoing project, a lot of my work is checking that the job is going well. And a lot of that is based on, you know, my expertise.  My expertise is learning design. It's how do you create effective online learning, but how do you create effective online learning in a learning design solutions manner?  And I'm just wondering, I mean, are we codifying that decision-making process or are getting to the point where we're saying, well, good looks like this because these are the kind of choices that Andrew's made at various stages?

29:53 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes, because for one part, something that we've already discussed is the necessity to train. don't know. So that they use your methodology and make decisions as you would make decisions and there's an argument there for at some point eventually also analyzing those operational workflows and implementing some kind of automated validation or automated checks into those workflows because there's there is always and always and always that element of human error and even if there is somebody following up on somebody's work and trying to make sure that everything is being covered even then there is human error and that's very operationally expensive but it's much cheaper and faster to run that first through some validation agent that has its checklist and make sure that it runs through that checklist in an automated way because then it's much less expensive and much faster.  And I don't know to what extent you might want in the future to also try experimenting a sort of learning design agent that might, my perspective here is that anything you can do to remove some of the rote work from what a human does is good.  Yeah. Because it allows them to focus on the expertise and the creative side of things.

31:33 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah. Yeah. And so I've got an agent for one end of the process because we've got an agent that we're using in the design stages, right?  So I've trained a GPT bot on my principles of learning design based on theoretical models and things like that.  And at the other end, you know, I can conceivably see how so the end product. Thanks. Thank you. It is a long work document, might be 15,000 words, that is the storyboard of the content that will then be built into the learning environment.  And that's what I've been spending this week reviewing is lots of them, like looking through those documents, seeing whether they're doing it right, what choices they've made, would I make the same choices?  And I can see how I could train a separate bot that is my quality assurance bot. And based on these decisions that you're talking about that I make, it can parse the document, it can analyze the document.  Now, of course, as you say, I look at what it comes out with. I then can apply that to the document and bring my expertise, which makes sure that the human element is still there.  And it's not arbitrary decisions. It's decisions based on the context of the document that's been produced. So, yeah, I can see that and also because I've already got to the point where the learning designers are using my bot to design the courses.  So, the courses that are coming out are a lot closer.

33:01 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  or to how I would design it myself than if I just let them get on with it and it already reduces the amount of quality assurance I have to do because they're already producing things and actually I'm just making notes I do need to do some more training of my bot because there's elements that are not consistently coming out the way that I would recommend yeah okay sorry I just went on a rant because you just made me think of that I'll make sure to send you the notes for these actionables so that you don't lose track of them yeah um so with that entire perspective in mind that leaves us with the processes for executing on the recordings that you have which will also become easier in time as you begin to implement the time tracking methodologies yeah um the implementation of time tracking yeah  about methodologies, which are not just to time track, but really they're about tracking your projects or milestones, your margins within these, your efficiencies.  And this will help you price future projects more effectively. If you want to be price competitive, it will also help you model and make estimates for profitability of projects way ahead of time.  And also capture elements that you might have missed when scoping out and estimating projects. And fundamentally, it will allow you to build a more scalable offering system as you begin to walk a bit away, because I'm also keeping in mind the objective of a potential exit within five to 10 years.  In parallel, the project and task management system. Now, this doesn't need to go out immediately. Immediately, but also because you're still working off of spreadsheets, spreadsheets are good to an extent, but they're not the best collaborative project and task management system, especially when dealing with multiple teams, multiple stakeholders, both from the client side, both internally to you and to multiple vendors, right?  You need to be able to abstract away some of these where you have full visibility, but clients only see what they need to see and vendors only see what they need to see, but everything is within the same system so that it can automatically be managed.  I've spoken just a little bit towards this task automation side of it, but it is a very, very, very complex system, right?  The benefits is project management. I actually wanted to ask with you, I know how much of a percentage it is as a percentage of overall projects on my end.  It used to be... In excess of 25% of all hours built. And this has been steadily going down, down, down, down, down, as we have more automation in the back end.  But I don't remember asking you explicitly if you can, at a glance, give a guess for how much of a given project is occupied by project and task management.

36:25 - Andrew Doig
  I guess I'd have to define project management because, yeah, it's distinguishing between, I guess, between project management and quality management.  I mean, a large part of my role is about managing resources and relationships. So my relationship with the client and my resources that I'm working for.  So, but how much of that is, yeah, I need a clear definition of which parts. Again, this is part of what we'll do by analysing my looms.  Which parts of what I do would you define as project management? Which bits are quality assurance? need definition of which parts.  So, the easy definition... don't have an answer to that because I couldn't tell you exactly. I know I do a shitload of project management, but I don't know exactly which bits you would describe, define as project management.

37:16 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So, within my worldview, project management begins at the point at which a project has actually been agreed, signed, paid for, or a framework for payments has been agreed, and the project effectively begins.  So, when you move from the offering stage where you haven't really built out the whole project, you just built a concept of a project, the moment that you begin to build out documentation, that's when project management begins, and it ends at the moment when you have turned in the final deliverable.  Yes, but...

37:59 - Andrew Doig
  Everything else, whether it's quality...

38:01 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Assurance, task management. But then that's the vast majority of what I do.

38:05 - Andrew Doig
  mean, when I'm not actually doing learning design, which occasionally I'm sucked into doing because of capacity. Or, for example, I've got one learning designer that left just before the end of a project.
  ACTION ITEM: Finalize blog posts for business dev by Monday
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/zMELWHoXtK2E7tFX4YVK9DHwXorBjgcd?timestamp=2297.9999  I had to pick it up. Actually, that's a big chunk of what I've been doing this week. So apart from when I'm actually doing hands-on learning design, everything I do is project management, I would have said.  Like, I'm not doing a great deal of business development in my week. I've got blog posts I need to finalize as part of my business development.  And actually, now I've said that, I kind of need to do that this weekend so that we can get them out on Monday.

38:40 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  We can further break that down inside of project management. So, as you say, the actual learning design. So the actual asset production and implementation is not project management, does not fall within the scope of project management.  But things like the communications, the communications of requirements, the validations of delivery. break inside of management. supportables, the quality assurance processes, and everything related to managing that falls within project management.  Now, as a percentage of projects, when you actually compare against the entire project, it's not 50, 60, 70%, obviously.  But that's just because the people that you outsource to and delegate to carry out the bulk of the project production.  But if this is the bulk of what you're doing, and this represents a majority of your time spent, the good news here is this is very friendly to automation.  Yeah.

39:42 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah.

39:44 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  All right.

39:45 - Andrew Doig
  And for sure, because something I have to do today for Walbrook, the client I'm working with, is put together a set of costs for 2026.  To do that, I need to make sure I know how many module developments we're having. So I'm going to sit with a whole bunch of spreadsheets and just count out and work out how many modules are going to be developed in 2026 and put a price against that.  And that is stuff that I know could be done better with automation and very quickly and much more efficiently with more accurate results as well.  But I don't have a mechanism for doing that. Yes.

40:33 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And that is part of the strategy. It's a critical part of the strategy. And it is also very, very relevant in terms of your growth.  It is what will make your business scalable. Yeah.

40:50 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, for sure. Okay. Let's see then.

40:55 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Where are we right now? Bum, bum, bum, clarifying.

41:02 - Andrew Doig
  I can hear my dog barking outside, which means my son let him out, and then my son left the building, so I'll have to let him back in.  Just one sec. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Cool. Okay.

41:59 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  At this point. So it's best that I present both the strategy and the offer to both you and Debbie.
  ACTION ITEM: Confirm Wed 10am meeting w/ Deb, update Vlad if changes
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/zMELWHoXtK2E7tFX4YVK9DHwXorBjgcd?timestamp=2527.9999  Yes. So we should schedule for next week. Yeah. Earlier next week, if you can, Friday, same time if you can't, whichever.

42:18 - Andrew Doig
  Let's have a look at next week. Could do a 10 o'clock on Wednesday. And I can double check that with Deb.  That's probably a better day for her. Let's take an hour at 10 o'clock on Wednesday. If you invite both of us and then I'll check with Deb.  As I say, she's teaching workshops. I won't see her till this evening. Yeah, that time is perfect for me.

42:41 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So I'll send the tentative invitation. That is Wednesday, September the 24th. Yep. Thank you. So And I've sent the invite.

43:13 - Andrew Doig
  Thank you very much. Okay, thanks a lot, Vlad. So between now and then, is there anything that you would like me to do if I can find capacity to do it?

43:23 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Please share credentials to the ScribeHow and Loom accounts so that I can begin to take a glance, look a little bit through the notes and transcripts, just analyze the kind of the time spent in the patterns.  I don't intend to be extracting information out of there. And I don't intend to be doing any, you know, systematization on it yet.  just want to get it.

43:54 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, yeah. All right.

43:56 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  If because I realize that is sensitive information, if you want us to sign an Extended NDA, anything for that, please let me know.

44:06 - Andrew Doig
  Maybe in that case, let's go through proposal and strategy next week before, and then we should probably get an NDA in place, and we'll start setting up that kind of access.  So let's get to that stage first. And I say an NDA will be needed, obviously, because there is sensitive data, there's client data in all of the work that I'm doing.  And, yeah, we need to protect that. So that's a very sound point. So let's move beyond that once we agree what our strategy is, what the engagement is.  But, you know, this is all super helpful for me. So I am keen to move forward and I'm keen to keep working with you.  As I say, just we need a very clear proposal of cost and benefit.

44:48 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes, most likely it will be structured in a way with some kind of monthly retainer. Yeah. Yeah. That it's...

45:04 - Andrew Doig
  And so what I would say, though, if you're going to documentize that proposal, think of us as a layman because you're very articulate, but sometimes you lose us, you know, you know, you've got a lot.  Just a quick question.

45:19 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Remember that simplified phase one that I showed you, which is now outdated. I've updated it already. OK, but was that the right format?  Good for you. That worked well for me.

45:30 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah. So that kind of thing. Yes.

45:33 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So that's the framework that I will be structuring it as. Awesome. And I'm not keen in general. I realize how difficult it must be for you, especially where you're estimating and budgeting such big projects.  I'm in general not very keen on estimating long, complex work quite that way. I'm confident about estimating them when they're sufficiently broken down.

46:01 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah. Yeah. We can approach it in, you know, we can chunk it and approach it in stages, phases, whatever.  That's fine.

46:09 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  That's the way I think it should always be approached. Like, okay, if we're working on time tracking frameworks and managing, budgeting your projects, we will just estimate that, we'll look at that, we'll deliver that, and every phase proceeds in that way.  Awesome.

46:26 - Andrew Doig
  Okay, cool. That works for me. All right, hopefully we'll see you, both see you on Wednesday.

46:32 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And if Debbie is unavailable, it's best that we just communicate and reschedule for when she is available, because it's best to hear her.

46:38 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, okay.

46:40 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  All right. Thanks a lot, Vlad.

46:42 - Andrew Doig
  Always a pleasure meeting you again, Andrew. All right, enjoy your weekend. You as well. Be healthy.
