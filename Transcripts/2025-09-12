0:00 - Andrew Doig
  Oh, hi. Good morning, Debbie. Good morning, Andrew. How are you?

0:05 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I am having some very good personal time. Since we last spoke, I went to my vacation where I underwent an extended fast.  I lost a lot of weight. So I'm doing real well, except now the family is at home and they're all coughing.

0:31 - Andrew Doig
  So when you say you did an extended fast, was it a retreat?

0:36 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes, it was organized as a 10-day retreat, fully watered fasting, no food, lots of physical exercise, lots of procedures, massages, cleansing exercises and the like.

0:51 - Andrew Doig
  Was that in Romania or was that somewhere else?

0:53 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  In Romania, there are a number of clinics that do this, but this one specifically... Thank you. It is more of a religious-themed kind of fasting, and what do we translate that?  We have a term, koka-inza, which roughly translates as some kind of penitence. Yeah. Repentance, yes. Fasting and repentance retreat.

1:20 - Andrew Doig
  Ah, so you also cleanse yourself of your sins while you were away.

1:25 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes. Quite a bit. Quite a bit.

1:28 - Andrew Doig
  That's why you're glowing, and your halo is shining. That's why you're glowing, yeah. Thank you.

1:35 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I was really surprised by how much easier it's been to temper impulses since I came back. So I'm still doing twice a week fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays, and I find that my other dopamine-requiring impulses have been easier to...  ... We're under control and moderate. Yeah, amazing.

2:04 - Andrew Doig
  We've had phases of fasting and haven't done it for a little while, but we, I mean, we usually do it in January anyway, and usually like the first like 10 days, not a total water fast, but yeah, definitely a big cleanse.  Yeah.

2:21 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  I find that it's a much more common occurrence than I thought before, where most of the people I speak with now, where I tell them where I went and what I did are like, yeah, I do.  I do that sometimes.

2:32 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, nothing quite as, you know, 10 days of water fast is, you know, I mean, you want to be able to do that in the right environment, don't you?  Yeah, absolutely.

2:47 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  That helped a lot, the fact that I had an organized frame where I could do that.

2:53 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, very interesting.

2:58 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So, coming... Away from how I'm doing, how are you doing? How have things been in the past? So a lot has been happening.

3:08 - Andrew Doig
  I will admit that I've not achieved much in terms of my to-do list, but other things have been happening as well.  Do you want to talk a bit about it? Yeah. So, yeah. Well, first of all, I think from the book that you recommended, the Profit First book, so I've been reading that.  We've been the process actually of changing our bank account. Well, we have changed. We've just, it's now all kind of come through.  So I'm going to sort of set up that kind of methodology and ways. So that was really helpful and useful.  And it's and, you know, I've been looking at the business in a slightly different way and I've been going through all those frameworks that he's given.  So that's been interesting. And then as far as sort of generating new business. So, um, I. We reached out to two of the different agents that Andrew's dealt with before, and so that's been really good and really helpful.  We've got one of the agents now who's a bigger agent that had got Andrew work in the past. The lady who was working there previously had left and really for the last two years have not really done, they haven't put any business our way at all.  But it's been good because we've spoken to various different people within their team, and I think they're all now much more on board with who we are, what we want, how they can help us.  And so, yeah, from that you've got a... Yeah, so, yeah, they've got a client meeting in a couple of weeks' time that one of the agents has set up.  One of the agencies I've gone back to because I needed to get staff from them. Before minion, one of the departments losses like,  Yeah, subcontractors, but actually that allows us to clarify the win-win, where if they can get me big projects, I can then subcontract staff from them and then, you know, add my own feet.  So they don't just get me as someone that they're making money off, they then get a team. So both the agents are quite keen on that.  And that's been good. And also with the one where you're working with, who've helped to find you and some of your staff, they're beginning to work more on that deliverables idea than the...  Yeah, yeah. So for one of the staff, groups of staff that I'm getting, for various reasons, I had agreed a reasonably lower feed than I normally would with the current client.  I was offshoring and that worked out badly. So I had to get UK resources at a cheaper rate and the agency actually put forward their proposal that we would invite against deliverables for that, those staff members.  So interesting. Certainly, they've already started doing that and just helps me rethink how I go about invoicing and setting up, proposing.  That's all starting to happen. It's starting to come together. And then there's another agent that Andrew dealt with previously, who he's just, he's just gone to a new company and so kind of wants to prove himself there, I think.  And what's been really helpful is because we were talking about how our big focus is to try and get in front of chartered institutes.  So anyway, basically, he's got contacts throughout the whole industry in online education. So he's been putting together all the institutes, the people to contact.  He's now contacted them on our behalf. And again, we're kind of setting up a sort of win-win where if that bites and we get some contracts from that.  Then we can use some of his people. So again, it builds an incentive for him. And, you know, he's somebody who understands this industry and it would take us a lot more time and energy.  And it's interesting that, you know, some of the actions that we've talked about with you about trying to automate, he's doing on our behalf.  So he has set up a three-step approach method. He will have a CRM because he's an agency. He's identified key stakeholders and is making the approaches on our behalf.  So, I mean, that's such a massive win because these are all things that would take time and thought and resource for us.  Whereas we don't have to pay him to do this because his win is that he will make money at the point where he lands the contract.

7:52 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  If I may, I do want to point out and make a small point of caution. And and then, That is, it sounds from the outside that both of these agents, right, both agencies are structuring the partnership in a way that gives them a systematic systematic method to follow to attract new conversations for this specific niche of service and to make more use of their own staff and their own teams through any engagement that is brought this way, which does position you as a leader of the projects, but it also does mean that in the long run, they may also be able to fully disengage.  If they ever find it worthwhile... Um, they might hire internally or they might have somebody that might, you know, remove.

9:07 - Andrew Doig
  Yes and no. I mean, neither, both are, are just agencies or just staffing resource agencies. They, uh, and I've worked with both.  Well, Sam is an individual. I've worked in other companies for about 10 years. Um, the other company I've worked for, for at least eight years.  Um, and I know the nature of their business. I know what they do and they're not running projects. They are, uh, matching resources to two projects.  Um, yes. I mean, you know, but it's on a client by client basis and we have contracts that are very robust contracts in place every time we set up a client relationship.  Um, you know, obviously we set sign NDRs at the beginning of it. Um, but then we are um, contracting.  Now, yes, potentially what we could do is continue to work with that client and step away from learning design solutions.  I find that highly unlikely because they are not going to make more money by bringing in another resource. You know, they're making money off me every day that I put into the project as billable via that agency.  Every member of staff that they pass to me, and we're still to work out quite the contract arrangements, but I will then be invoicing the client with my percentage on top of them, whether that's as a day rate or as a project, you know, set of deliverables.  So I have quite a high level of trust and links. mean, maybe that's waiting to get my fingers burned, but again, I've got a depth of experience.  Yeah, and yeah, you've had a longstanding relationship with them. So I really think that's...

10:53 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  If the longstanding relationship is there, and if you have good contracts, and if the structure makes sense, then it's not a...  Problem in any way. I did feel it worthwhile mentioning because you do have to have those fallbacks in place in that situation.

11:10 - Andrew Doig
  If this was someone new, it was someone that had cold call me on LinkedIn, if it was someone that was coming to me to propose these models, I would be more suspicious, more cautious about it.  I mean, the one thing is that it's only, as I say, I've had a working relationship with these people for a long time now.  It's only Debbie coming in and actually chasing them and putting forward ideas and, you know, giving them a description of what the company does and what I do that has led to these opportunities arising.  So it's not like they've been hungrily trying to poach me into an arrangement that eventually they're going to step away from and benefit from.  So, no, I don't think we're taking much of a risk now. Okay.

11:59 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Um, Another observation is it's actually very interesting because, as you say, rather than requiring the automation of a discrete pipeline that would do this without the human element, now they have an incentive to do this on your behalf to absorb a lot of the costs that have to do with setting up that pipeline.  And that pipeline is specific to their businesses because they already have presence and relationships and are in a very good position to carry out these conversations.  So from a strategic point of view, having your own pipeline that you monitor and track can be changed or can be adapted for this kind of channel, where your channel, rather than directly contacting the kinds of institutions that you want and trying to establish this.  The conversations with stakeholders directly yourself could be set up as a referral channel through staffing agencies or other kinds of relevant agencies that also already maintain these kinds of relationships.  And rather than you maintaining the pipeline, you just need to maintain the relationships with these agencies, with these partnerships, as well as keep track of the clients that you already signed up within your own infrastructure and then your own communications, but with much less complexity of the overall system.

13:44 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, and I think one of the advantages of this current approach is it's something that, at this stage, Debbie's comfortable managing.  Yeah. You know, as soon as we start getting into automation and computer-based systems and that kind of tracking, there's more of a learning curve for you, right?  There is, but I... I also sort of think, you know, currently, where our energy is best placed. And, you know, for me, you know, I mean, obviously, it's generating new business.  So with both the agents, I mean, we've already got with one of them, you've got a meeting next week with a potential client, you know, and with the other one, he's now on our behalf contacting all the, you know, he's got leads within this industry.  So to me, it's like, that is a really big win. Plus, through your existing contacts, you've got another new potential project.  And also with the company that you're working with now, there's a potential of that being a bigger, more international one.  So I kind of feel like we've got a lot of bases covered at the moment. And outside of that, when it comes to any sort of automation or reaching out beyond that, I feel that's a bit beyond that.  Thank We don't have capacity for that at the moment. Yeah. That, you know, as we know, these things ebb and flow, and it might be as it did this year, and we're get into the early stages of next year, that that dips away, and that might be the time when we want to be proactive about building a better pipeline.  But it might also be that I've landed two more projects, and I'm having subcontract some, you know, managers below me that are running the projects for me, which is what we're aiming at, really.

15:29 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  To an extent, yes, yes.

15:31 - Andrew Doig
  And on that line-up, because again, interestingly, I want to talk to you about it, but I haven't started using Loom or Scriber or whatever it was called.  But I've just recently read a book called The E-Myth. Do you know The E-Myth? At this point, it's a classic.

15:50 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  It's going on maybe two decades old. Yeah, absolutely. mean, it was written in the 90s, I think.

15:56 - Andrew Doig
  But I say read it, I skimmed it, because there's loads of stuff, but it's just flim-flam. But it kind of ties in with what you were saying about getting standard opposite operating procedures, you know, that concept of franchising your business, even if you're not going to franchise it, you have to have everything declared and trackable.
  ACTION ITEM: Begin documenting SOPs for learning designer role and management tasks.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xKsChD5zWqjHdZWBBGtZFTdvxjzKEzhH?timestamp=965.9999  And on the back of that, I started doing that. I've actually started doing that for the main role I self-contract as a learning designer.  And I've been bringing in a lot of learning designers who have varying degrees of knowledge and skill, and I need them to work in my way.  So luckily, because I've been running a chat GPT bot for a long time, doing my work with me, that's able to help me start to create SOPs.  So I've done it in a very light touch way, as in just a weekly schedule of what the deliverables are across each week of a 16-week development project.  I'm going to go into more detail and start expanding that. But I am definitely very interested in capturing SOPs for what I do as a director or as a manager, a director, because exactly.  That if the conversation I'm having in two weeks' time leads to another development project, well, I need to hand off managing my current client to my second command, and I need her to know what she needs to be doing.  So I need to have SOPs for my work. And again, if we get a third client, then I need to bring in someone that's not been working with me probably for nearly as much.  And so it makes total sense at this point for me, if we're going to expand successfully, which, you know, and your support has been really, really important in this.  If we're going to expand successfully, I really recognize the value of having all that stuff written down, declared, and shareable.

17:44 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Excellent. I want to share one thing a little out of context. So now that we're talking books, I would say there are five books that matter that are the source of everything that I've been sharing with you so far.  Okay. E-mail is one, Profit First is the other, Business Systems Explains is the third.

18:08 - Andrew Doig
  I'll write that one down. Donald Miller's Story Brand Framework is the fourth. I've got that sitting upstairs, actually. When I first set up the business, a friend of mine recommended that to me.

18:20 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And the fifth, I always have to look up the name of. I'll have to follow up with it. I always forget its name.  It's also around Business Systems. It's not so much a book as it is a kind of a brochure. So with that, I'll have to follow up.  But they are an excellent set of principles for looking at and running, especially small to medium businesses, where you don't have the culture already and you have to build a culture to close with you.  And please correct me if I misunderstand. understand. understand. understand. And... Or misunderstood. But at the moment, the pipeline development is an exercise in discovery, so to speak, because you have identified a channel through already well-connected agencies as partners.  They can be staffing agencies. They may be other kinds of agencies. So all of these institutions already have connections with and relationships with various kinds of agencies.  So assuming an update of the strategy around how your pipeline might look, a dedicated section of it might be just identifying the agencies that are already connected to the institutions of interest, and then having a process for engaging with them and establishing these kinds of relationships with them.  Yeah.

19:59 - Andrew Doig
  I mean, we've, we've. I mean, there was probably about four or five agencies that were working in digital education, online learning, e-learning, education technology, the space that I'm in.

20:16 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And ideally the kinds of agencies that do not overlap their services with you. So staffing agencies, yes, whereas learning design agencies, maybe not so much.

20:27 - Andrew Doig
  Not that, no, no, staffing agencies is what we're interested in, ones that can get contracts, not ones that, the only way, so the only slight, so the businesses I used to work for are OPM, online program management.  Online program management offer services to universities so they can take programs online and one of their services is learning design.  Then they've got marketing, recruitment, technology, student support. And business processes, no, some of those. I don't actually invest a great deal in learning design.  And the only opening that might be for me is to come in and be subcontracted to them to do the learning design provision.  That's definitely a possibility I have in mind, but it's not a target of mine at the moment. I don't particularly want to be dependent on a parent company like that.  I'd rather be just a direct supplier to the institution. I mean, I think that would be really if you absolutely had to.  Or if a great opportunity came along. If one of the businesses I used to work for comes along to me and says, look, Andrew, we know you do this.  Well, no. Of one of the two businesses, because one I wouldn't work for again, came along and said, Andrew, we're way beyond capacity.  We've got a project for the next two years. Can you scale up? And I'll come in and do it.  But that would be a direct approach from them to me rather than me seeking it out.

21:50 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  And also in order to service that kind of proposal, we would need to touch on the second part now.  And that is the scalability of your. Ability to subcontract, the learning design manager role, as well as the project manager role, since that doesn't have a direct answer yet.  And so there's a further layer of abstraction here, where if you begin to effectively delegate both processes, you are now, you would then be in the role where you get to try to scale that.  Once those, the actual design, you know, the learning design can be scaled by hiring and training more designers, and then the management, either by hiring project managers or having an effective project management system.

22:54 - Andrew Doig
  I'm aging towards that for this current project, for the big client I've got at the moment, I have one.  She's designer who's acting as senior learning designer, so she's carrying out a supervisory role on the quality, but she also has experience of project management of these kind of projects.  So I'm talking to her and already prepping her for the idea that, you know, it's likely come 2026 that I will need to go off and start onboarding another client and I would like her to take over the direct organization and running of the project.  Potentially, you know, if there's a realistic pipeline of two and then in the future, third and more clients, I might actually take her on as a member of staff as the only other member of staff on the project.  And she's already doing four days a week committed to me to learning design solutions. So we'll just work out for her and for us what's better.  But anyway, and then I have in my pool, you know, a lot of people that can do the hands on job.  But some of those are already running their own businesses. They're just not as good at finding business. And they are.  Obviously, I then put them on an almost double day rate to what they're on as a learning designer and becomes attractive to them.  Again, I'm in the process of establishing people that I trust out of the pool of learning designers that I'm working with, but I know some of them have senior experience.  Okay.

24:19 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  That would place you in a direction where you would rather begin working on the architecture of the business as a whole and scaling departments as opposed to individual processes.  Yeah.

24:33 - Andrew Doig
  Yes and no. mean, obviously, I've got to articulate what the processes are so that the delegation can cascade. If I start with the learning designers and I manage getting a clear SOPs for all the stages that the learning designers have to do, then a person managing them has those in hand to check that the LDs are doing their job in the right way, in a timely way.  One of the things on the list of things I've not done yet is getting checklists for quality. Like what does good.  Look like. And again, these are all things that I'll start working with on and on the next phase. So I'm already quite a lot closer to, for me, the management of the learning designers.  And then if I take a step up further, what is my role in managing them? How can I turn that into SOPs and like numbers of touch points with a learning designer?  How to make sure that they're onboarded correctly and all of these elements that I can start to hand off to a sub manager?  And yes, I would want to be sitting over an architecture of multiple projects where I'm just doing a lot less.  At the moment, I'm still doing quite a lot of hands-on. I'm still jumping in and fixing modules when the person has gone awry on it.  And that ends up sucking up so much of my time. So I need to pull myself out and stop doing that.  And that will be necessitated as soon as I have more than one big client, because I just won't have the capacity to do that.  Yeah. All

26:02 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Now, there's a couple of questions that I have regarding and trying not to put the cart before the horse, because obviously you need to have the new clients and you need to have the challenge of delegating those new clients to even worry about things like scaling the architecture of how you manage multiple projects simultaneously.  But one relevant factor in any of these situations has to do with the cost of execution of the project.  So the faster, more accurate, and cheaply you can execute on the projects, the less human resources need to be mobilized for each individual project.  The better pricing you can offer, the more projects you can honor at any given time within a certain standard of quality.  Which brings us to automation and AIs, or just automation. The good part about that is it also... unlocks profitability for you now with your current project, with your upcoming projects, and it unlocks more profitability and standardization for any new project that you will undertake.  Because if you start hiring without having all of the SOPs codified, without having automation where possible implemented for them, and without having things that already run standardized clockwork, then you will need to do it under pressure.  And you may run into the effect that I've noticed in other organizations that staff a lot of new people frequently, where they are unable to maintain standardization of processes and harmonization of culture over time.  Because having too short deadlines and hiring too fast, they don't define their culture. Instead, the culture begins to be defined by the people.  They bring in and their own set of methodologies and working practices, which also don't get codified, so then when those people eventually leave for one reason or another, they take their processes with them, and the organization actually starts from zero again.  Yeah, I do recognize that.

28:18 - Andrew Doig
  That's basically what I did at HEP. I changed their culture and then was removed from that culture. Yeah, no, I recognize that.  Okay.

28:29 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Now, would you agree or how do you feel about the way to address that being on your part, the codification of SOPs for now?  And then mainly the next focus being the harmonization of your business tactics, the ones that come from Profit First, for one, with the implementation of formal systems around how you run your projects, so that when  You do bring people in. They are trained in your systems methodology and supported by the tooling that we put in place to automate.

29:09 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, that's where I need to go, because at the moment, everything has been very informal, mostly with some ad hoc documentation, because that's just intuitively how I did it.  But I think I need to do exactly what you said. I need to get a bit more formalized about those processes.  Yeah. Okay.

29:32 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  That, have we covered everything that we had? Let me very quickly check my notes.

29:39 - Andrew Doig
  I need to ask you about Loom and things like that before we stop the conversation, so just make sure we cover that off.  Certainly.

29:49 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So, in terms of accounting, cash flows, and moving on to deliverable-based invoicing, for the accounting, you've carried out the processes, I believe.  Steve, you completely finished, you had to do that end of last month, right? Sorry, which processes? So at, you were going to need to undergo some accounting processes.  You basically had to do all of your reporting. Oh, yeah, yeah.

30:21 - Andrew Doig
  So I have mechanisms, fairly manual mechanisms, for tracking the spend on each module, each micro project. That's in place.  Yeah, so I have that in place. So that's, you know, it's interesting, we've moved now towards kind of a hybrid, because the learning designers and technologists are invoicing me on a day rate.  And I'm moving more, although my quote was on a day rate, I'm basically making sure we get value out of each development.  I'm looking at what's been delivered in a month, and what did I say that would cost them, and invoicing against that cost.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft proposal for new client fees due to shift from offshore resources.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xKsChD5zWqjHdZWBBGtZFTdvxjzKEzhH?timestamp=1852.9999  So, yes, I've got that in place. And then we've got a phase two where we need to sort of...  Well, actually, this weekend or early next week, I need to propose a new set of fees for the client because of the shift away from offshore resources, which they've recognised.  But luckily, they also recognise the quality of the deliverable, so they're happy to negotiate on that, which is a big win.  And with this current client, I don't think I can shift to telling them we're moving on to a deliverables-based costing structure.  I think about how I phrase that. But, I mean, ultimately, each project has a max cost against it. Each module development, which has been agreed with them, because this is how I told them I was going to do it.  I've been invoicing, this is how many days I've been spent on learning designers. I did at the end of the last month ask, could I just start invoicing per project rather than per role in that project?  I haven't had a response to that, so I need to follow. So we're moving towards that. I am tracking the costs.  I am trying to make sure we get max value out of each development project. And really, we've kind of recognised that from, I've already been able to build in a bit more profit into that because of actually our spend and then what we've estimated.  So, but, yeah, we definitely want to move on to that deliverable model. Yeah.

32:29 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Okay. And since August, for now, you have not been recording using either ScribeHow or Loom. So we kind of have to assume we will implement this going forward.  Well, so that, can I ask you about that now then?

32:45 - Andrew Doig
  Let me, because, let's get that up on screen. I mean, so if I just, sorry, I'm working between, between windows.  So where's share screen is there? go. back. Here we we What confused me was that Loom, what it promotes itself as, if you repeat to me how I combine these to track myself, because Loom brands itself as screen recording for sending out messages, for training, which would be short recordings, but I'm sure you said about just basically getting it started at the beginning of the day, and then letting it run.  Unfortunately, I didn't have clear enough notes. How do I combine to make sure I'm capturing what I do every day?

33:49 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So, both of them rely on a Chrome extension to execute, and so they are, whereas Loom also allows It you to run it to record your entire desktop, but you have to give it additional permission for that.  Now, it brands itself as short messages, but I also use it to record very large chunks of time, but it is fully video, right?  So you're recording video. It does produce some transcripts. You're able to then trim, separate, clone, right? So from one big video, you are able to split it into component parts where relevant.  If you say, oh, from here to here, I did this, and I want to just clone the video and store that part and share just that part within the process.  Yeah. Especially because it's powerful transcription functionality and detection of what's happening allows you to make one video with chapters, with annotations, with transcripts, so all of the information that is necessary.  So, but if I...

35:01 - Andrew Doig
  Install it as a Chrome extension. Is it only recording what I'm doing in Chrome, or is it recording my desktop?

35:06 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  It is capable of recording your entire desktop, but on Mac, you have to take some steps to make that happen.  So Loom, Mac, entire desktop. There's a setting that you have to change, and you have to download. So there's also a Loom desktop app that you can download, and that will enable you to do a full screenshot.

35:30 - Andrew Doig
  OK, I'll work that out, and I'll get the videos. But is it using Loom that you were saying I should be articulating what I'm doing at each phase so that there's a transcript?  Like, is it using my inbuilt mic, it'll be able to pick up what I'm saying?

35:45 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes. Yes, it will.

35:47 - Andrew Doig
  OK. And if I'm right, you were saying that basically when I sit down at my desk, I start our Loom recording and just get on with my day, stating each phase what I'm doing, why I'm doing it.  videos get 안된. But, Thank And then at the end of the day, what do I do with that recording?

36:07 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  So at the end of the day, the recording should be, we would be taking the transcript and classifying what you did.  The app is highly capable of detecting what you do. So working off of the transcript, it's easy to pick out, okay, this portion, you just say, wait, now I'm starting work on X, right?  So then we're going to search the transcript. We're going to know exactly from that recording when you did the work on X.  Of course, when you take a break, you might just as well stop recording and restart recording when you come back.  You might have three, four, five videos for a given day. The important part is just having that logged because then it's much easier to take 15, 30 minutes, come back, look up the recording.  And say, Okay, okay. I executed five processes today, and I have all of them recorded here. They might have caveats, they might have things that have not been covered, but you made progress, right?  And especially early on, it's very difficult to make progress deliberately. So as a shortcut to get you into the right frame of mind, just recording outright helps a lot.  Okay, where it differs from Scribe is Scribe is much more tactical. So when you use Scribe to record what you're doing, you have to do this on the process that you're doing.  So you don't get to just record the entire day and then split up the SOPs that way, or at least not when I used it.  It's not as suited to that. But where it differs from Loom is Scribe will produce a document. That has text, has screenshots, has links, has step-by-step-by-step information.  With Loom, you're feeding somebody a video and expecting them to watch the video. With Scribe, when you're recording a process, at the end of it, an SOP draft is waiting for you.  And yeah, you make some updates to the draft, maybe you edit something.

38:29 - Andrew Doig
  Right now, I'm working on onboarding new staff members, and I start Scribe while I do that task, and get it to stop at the end of that, and then get it to create an SOP around that.
  ACTION ITEM: After Loom familiarity, download Scribe. Learn usage for SOP creation.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xKsChD5zWqjHdZWBBGtZFTdvxjzKEzhH?timestamp=2311.9999  Yes. So basically, Loom will help me identify what I do with my days, and if I use that for a week or two, I can start to chunk out, well, these are the things that I'm doing.  And I would follow that up, possibly with Scribe, and say, right, now I know I'm working on responding to the weekend's worth of email.  So I'll get Scribe to record what I'm doing on screen, and Scribe I don't need to talk to. Scribe is identifying what's happening on screen and turning that into an SOP.

39:13 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yes, and I would encourage you to try to start the Loom when you start working and try to start Scribe when you do a process.  Don't wait two weeks. I can just try to use it regardless of the moment. You don't want someone else.  If you don't want someone else, you don't want someone You don't understand the concept of fasting much? Yeah.
  ACTION ITEM: Download Loom, learn usage. Start recording work day on Monday. Review by Friday.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xKsChD5zWqjHdZWBBGtZFTdvxjzKEzhH?timestamp=2380.9999

39:47 - Andrew Doig
  Okay. Okay, so and we can keep in conversation with that. I will start with Loom. I'll download it, learn how to use it this weekend on Monday.  I'll start recording myself. I'll see where I get to by Friday, whether it's any making any sense to me at all.  And then see where we get to from there, because I like the fact scribe says on the front on their homepage, create SOPs.  it's like, yeah, that's what I need to do. And so, but I like the idea of using Loom to actually identify how my day breaks up.  So yeah, okay, cool. I understand, I understand, but didn't do it. And I completely forgot. So I got a better idea now.  I know what it's like.

40:28 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  An important concept that's not obvious with something like Loom is I frequently drag videos into Gemini, for example, and they might be two hours worth of video because I need to do a classification of screens I've gone through, the information I'm working with.  I need to extract information from the video. So I literally upload a two hour video into Gemini and query the video.  So Gemini is like HPT. Zemini is the one with the millions of tokens capability.

41:06 - Andrew Doig
  Zemini would be better for processing sort of large form inputs like that.

41:12 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  It's pretty much the only real option now. Quads say that they've also got a million token limit now, but it's not effective.  Okay. Not effective. So that's a secondary thing. It's not immediately relevant to things like recording your SOP necessarily, but you will need to systematize all your business operations.  And to do so, you're going to need a lot more data and a lot more information. That makes sense.

41:49 - Andrew Doig
  That makes sense to you. Kind of. But I do know that makes total sense to me.

41:55 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  You most likely will also need to go probably straight for the pay plans because with... Boom, the free plan is time-limited, so you're going to use that.

42:05 - Andrew Doig
  No, the entry level is like 15 pounds a month, and there's up 20 pounds a month, you get a little bit more.  I'll decide which one to do. I don't have a Gemini account, but we'll come to that eventually. So I'll start with Loom, I'll move on to Scribe once I've got my head around using that.

42:26 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  If you have a Gmail, you have a Gemini account. Oh, okay. I'd love to use the LinkedIn WhatsApp. Okay, okay.

42:33 - Andrew Doig
  All right, that's cool, I didn't realize that. Okay, so, yeah. All right.

42:39 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  In regards to documentation around project and task management, contractor management, I know you haven't gotten to record any of the processes, but did you have any of those compiled, or do you have any progress on that front?

42:55 - Andrew Doig
  So, I mean, I don't have documentation around. I don't don't just That because everything I've been doing has been me in my head.  This is what we're needing to unpack now. And I see a need based on the number of developments that I've got coming up.  And, you know, for a client, I have spreadsheet based, but I have very detailed plans around which projects are starting, which month, what's the duration.  And it's usually awaiting until the other time, the names of the learning designer and the subject matter expert that are collaborating.  So I know what's coming up. I know what my current resources are. And the majority of subcontracts I'm working on are not working exclusively for me.  So, you know, I can only use them for a limited number of projects. So, but all of that I've just been doing because I know it needs to be done.  And this is something I've done for a long time. don't have any documentation around that. And again, this is probably stuff I need to capture because if I want to hand off, I can't make the assumption that  Anyone I hand it to immediately knows how it happens and how we manage that. So no, I don't have that.  This is stuff that I'm hoping, because a lot of my day is taken up. So this project now has new developments starting every month.  So every month I need to make sure I've got a plan of the learning designers. And if a learning designer has finished a project here, then I can cascade them down into a new project here.  Or I've got no one to cascade, so I need to have new resources. How am I getting the new resources?  Again, all of this is just me intuitively responding to the needs in the project. There is no process behind that.
  ACTION ITEM: Prepare proposal for time tracking implementation, tracking deliverables against projects and expenses.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/xKsChD5zWqjHdZWBBGtZFTdvxjzKEzhH?timestamp=2683.9999  Well, no declared process. There's loads of process. It's just not a declared process. And that's what I need to get to.

44:47 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Okay. So I had one actionable myself from our last meeting. And that is the one on updating the strategy with proposals for time tracking implementation, tracking deliverables.  Projects projects, projects against clients, and vendor deliverables against projects. Now, for a bunch of them, I still need input from you rather than giving the proposal myself.  Yeah. But at least for the time tracking implementation as well as setting up a system to track the deliverables against projects and expenses against projects, I can produce an update and give you a proposal.  Should we schedule for next week to follow up? See what progress you've had on the...

45:45 - Andrew Doig
  Yeah, that's just a quick touch base to tell you how I'm getting on and actually ask you questions about Loom.  I'm now, because we've come out in summer, we've covered everything that's been going on, like we had a short break last weekend.  with rates for And and then I A bit more committed to getting my head down and turning around these documentations.  So, and to be honest, this is me being honest, honest face, I hadn't looked at my to-do list until yesterday thinking, oh crap, I'm meeting Vlad tomorrow, I better have a look at that.  So, I'm not going anywhere doing anything this weekend, I will spend time with this and start working through the action.  So yeah, let's meet next Friday, same time if that works for you. Wait for me, because I'm going to teach you that day.  Debbie's teaching that day, that's fine. you me for that one. And that will motivate me, because there's a short duration to that tiny little project space there, that will motivate me to get as much as I can done over the next week.  Excellent.

46:48 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Then I have sent you the updated invite, and I am looking forward to checking in with you next week.  Awesome. Great. Thanks.

46:57 - Andrew Doig
  Thanks, Brian. very much. And I'm thrilled by the updates that you had.

47:01 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Yeah, there has been a lot going on, that's for sure.

47:04 - Andrew Doig
  I haven't done your list, but we've done a lot of stuff at our site, and a lot of that's been inspired by what you've talked us through.  Yeah, and it also means that I think it's cementing things, it's things making more sense. So, you know, we're getting there.

47:18 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Clarity helps a lot.

47:22 - Andrew Doig
  Brilliant. Well, keep glowing, I think is what we'll say.

47:27 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Thank you.

47:29 - Andrew Doig
  All right, have a good week. Thanks, Vlad. Take care. Bye. You guys all.

47:32 - Vlad Tudorie (Serenichron)
  Do well.
